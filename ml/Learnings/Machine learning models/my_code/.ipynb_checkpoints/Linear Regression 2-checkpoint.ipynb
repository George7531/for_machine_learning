(not a good idea if the column or feature has greater predictive ability for the model) for example very few houses in the recent days have swimming pool attached with them, House owners demand for it. But 99.5% of the houses built uptil now do not sport a swimming pool. But those few in the recent years might be indicative of an emerging trend of house owners in the future demanding for a swimming pool when ordering a house construction. so dropping this feature off might deprive our machine learning model of its ability to make good prediction about the house prices.\n",
