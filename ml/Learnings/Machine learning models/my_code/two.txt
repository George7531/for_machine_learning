Dogs poop everywhere

if you do not take your dogs out, they will poop all over your house.

dogs sometimes unnecessarily bark at strangers. 

their incessant barks are a right set of tools to jolt you up from your bed at night. 

i do not know how secure they can keep your be but they are a great nuisance to your sleep.
