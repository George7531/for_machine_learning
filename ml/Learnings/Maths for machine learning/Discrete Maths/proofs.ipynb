    "# Proofs are proven for Eternity:\n",

    "\n",
    "* In mathematics once something is proven then, it is proven for eternity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The statement \"In mathematics, once something is proven, then it is proven for eternity\" is generally accurate. Mathematical proofs are based on logic and reasoning, and once a proof has been established, it cannot be overturned without identifying a flaw in the reasoning. This is because mathematics deals with abstract concepts and relationships that are not subject to change in the same way that physical phenomena can be altered by new discoveries or advancements in technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, there are some important caveats to this statement. First, mathematical proofs are only as strong as the axioms and assumptions upon which they are built. If these axioms or assumptions are later found to be incorrect, then the proof may no longer be valid. For example, the Euclidean parallel postulate, which is the foundation of Euclidean geometry, was once considered to be an absolute truth. However, non-Euclidean geometries, such as hyperbolic and elliptic geometries, have been developed that do not satisfy the parallel postulate, demonstrating that it is not a necessary truth of mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second, mathematical proofs are always subject to human error. There is always the possibility that a mistake has been made in the reasoning, or that a flaw in the proof has been overlooked. As a result, mathematical proofs are constantly being scrutinized and re-examined, and new proofs may be developed that are more concise, elegant, or insightful than the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Despite these caveats, the statement that \"In mathematics, once something is proven, then it is proven for eternity\" remains largely true. Mathematical proofs are the bedrock of our understanding of the universe, and they provide a foundation for science, engineering, and technology. While mathematical proofs are not infallible, they are incredibly powerful tools for understanding the world around us."
