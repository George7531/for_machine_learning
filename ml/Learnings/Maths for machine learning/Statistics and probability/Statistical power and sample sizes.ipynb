    "----------\n",
    "* and also sometimes having the null hypothesis distribution and alternate hypothesis distribution so close to each other with strong kurtosis without leaving gaps for False positive and False negative such that we will have the highest statistical power(True Positive: 1-beta) is just meaningless or purposeless because it will happen so only for the obvious events such as checking the brain activity of a dead person and proving that he has none which is already an obvious fact and you don't have to break any sweat to prove it, do ya? sometimes higher statistical power only comes for obvious events or well known facts which do not require additional studies.\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "* do not engage in decreasing the alpha threshold too much it might inadvertantly increase the Type 1 Error (Rejecting the null hypothesis even though it is True: False Positive).\n",
    "---------\n",
    "* Also be mindful of the fact that statistical power might differ for different analysis with the same data which means in one experiment might give a higher number for 1-beta but another experiment (with different methods adopted but still using the same data) might give a different statistical power.\n",
    "------------\n",
    "* statistical power calculation from published scientific reports are also unreliable because sometimes the nuances or the obvious facts are overlooked. Also when you look at all the published literature you'd only find them reporting statistically significant reports but sometimes some metrics might not be statistically significant and they are not published. Because of this publication bias we might not get the full picture of the observed reality(we cannot measure the workings of the God/Nature with selection bias to only select and publish those that are seemingly important while discarding the seemingly unimportant results. Who knows sometimes the real discovery emerge from the obvious things that were once overlooked.)\n",
