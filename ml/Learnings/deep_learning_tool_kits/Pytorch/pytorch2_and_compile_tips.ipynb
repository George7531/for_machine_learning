Higher the Bandwidth slower the data processing.\n","* the fusion aspect of the torch.compile arranges them neatly in such a way that the operation is less bandwidth consuming and therefore faster transmission of data from CPU to GPU.\n","\n","![sfsf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/extras-memory-bandwidth-output-small.gif)\n","\n","\n","* So instead of performing an operation on a piece of data and then saving the result to memory (increased bandwidth costs), you chain together as many operations as possible via fusion.\n","\n","* A rough analogy would be using a blender to make a smoothie.\n","\n","* Most blenders are good at blending things (like GPUs are good at performing matrix multiplications).\n","\n","* Using a blender without operator fusion would be like adding each ingredient one by one and blending each time a new ingredient is added. Not only is this insane, it increases your bandwidth cost.\n","\n","* The actual blending is fast each time (like GPU computations generally are) but you lose a bunch of time adding each ingredient one by one.\n","\n","* Using a blender with operator fusion is akin to using a blender by adding all the ingredients at the start (operator fusion) and then performing the blend once.\n","\n","* You lose a little time adding at the start but you gain all of the lost memory bandwidth time back.\n","\n","* fusing the operation is instead of writing the code like tom = np.sin(np.pi) banu = np.cos(tom) sam = banu+5 * np.sin(np.pi), we fuse them together to make them look: np.cos(np.sin(np.pi)) + 5 * np.sin(np.pi), to get all the operation done in one shot rather than in silos.\n","\n","\n","## graph tracing:\n","* it is the process of the algorithm running through the whole network to the final outcome before it acutally executes the operations in the network.\n","* it is just like the min-max algorithm in the adversarial network where the algorithm before taking the next step to defeat the opponent, it runs the simulation in its head, working out all combination of its choices and its opponent choices and make the next move based on what's ideal. it can see things 10's 1000's of moves ahead and make effective decisions.\n","* this is graph tracing: think before you act!!!\n","\n","![fsfs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/extras-graph-capture.gif)\n","\n","\n","* but the caveat is this graphing or thinking ahead of time or doing operation before it is due actually takes some upfront time but the subsequent operations will be smooth as butter.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"djk8dFbDkKbK"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AWcxlNzbgF0N","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712158617020,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3094,"user":{"displayName":"george
