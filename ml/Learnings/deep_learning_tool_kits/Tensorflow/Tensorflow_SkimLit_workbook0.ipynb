'OBJECTIVE\\tThe aim of this study was to test if attention bias for food moderates the effect of self-reported emotional eating during sad mood ( vs neutral mood ) on actual food intake .\\n',\n"," 'OBJECTIVE\\tIt was expected that emotional eating is predictive of elevated attention for food and higher food intake after an experimentally induced sad mood and that attentional maintenance on food predicts food intake during a sad versus a neutral mood .\\n',\n"," 'METHODS\\tParticipants ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental mood induction conditions ( sad/neutral ) .\\n',\n"," 'METHODS\\tAttentional biases for high caloric foods were measured by eye tracking during a visual probe task with pictorial food and neutral stimuli .\\n',\n"," 'METHODS\\tSelf-reported emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire ( DEBQ ) and ad libitum food intake was tested by a disguised food offer .\\n',\n"," 'RESULTS\\tHierarchical multivariate

Classification sure do exist but it doesn't take the wheel forever.\n","\n","* For example when we worked with image classification tasks we get prediction probability array from the softmax function that comprised of something like this [0,0,0,0.99,0] here the number in the 4th index that is 1 will be considered but every other number besides it will be ignored\n","\n","* what label smoothing does is it distributes the probability to the neighbors to make the above array look [0.2,0.2,0.2,0.91,0.2]. This is what label smoothing. what it implies is we are not sure whether the 4th index is the thing we want or searching for it could be that the other things could be the thing we were searching for as well. But selection still depends on the largest probability so the element in the index 4 with the largest probability 0.91 will be chosen over others.\n","\n","* why do label smoothing though? I think it is due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the language, usage of words, selection of words, construction of sentences and so on.. perhaps the selection of the next word I choose to write here is not completely fixed to any specific word and one word among myriads of words with different probability ratio is chosen aptly.
