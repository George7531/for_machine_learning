      "PPO is an actor-critic algorithm developed by Christian Kingma and Barry Silverstein in 2016. It's a variant of the policy gradient method, which is used to optimize the policy parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea behind PPO is to use two policies: one for predicting next actions (Q-value) and another for selecting actions (α-value). The Q-function predicts the expected return from taking an action in a given state, while the α-value selects the optimal action based on the Q-values of the next states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a high-level overview of how PPO works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **State-action pair**: You interact with the environment and take actions.\n",
      "2. **Q-function prediction**: The policy predicts the expected return (Q-value) from taking an action in the current state.\n",
      "3. **α-value selection**: The policy selects the optimal action based on the Q-values of the next states.\n",
      "4. **Loss calculation**: You calculate a loss function that combines the difference between your estimated Q-values and the true Q-values, as well as the squared differences between your α-values and the true α-values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PPO algorithm uses a double Q-learning approach to improve the exploration-exploitation trade-off:\n",
      "\n",
      "* In each iteration, you query both policies (Q-value and α-value) for the next action.\n",
      "* The policy with the lower loss is selected as the optimal action.\n",
      "* You update the parameters of the policies using the expected returns from the queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**\n",
      "\n",
      "SAC is an actor-critic algorithm developed by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto in 2016. It's a variant of deep Q-learning, which combines the strengths of policy gradients and deep neural networks.\n",

      "3. **α-value selection**: The policy selects the optimal action based on the Q-values of the next states, which is computed using a different architecture than PPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "SAC uses a two-player actor-critic algorithm:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Player 1 (Policy)**: Predicts the expected return (Q-value) from taking an action in the current state.\n",

      "**What is Reinforcement Learning?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns from interacting with an environment. The goal is to achieve a specific objective, like playing a game or completing a task. 🎮\n",

      "**Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**\n",
      "\n",
      "🔁 **The Magic of Proximal Policy Optimization**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're playing a video game, and the AI needs to decide when to take risks and when to play it safe. PPO is an optimization algorithm that helps the AI learn from its experiences in a self-supervised manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The agent observes the environment (e.g., game state) and decides what action to take.\n",
      "2. The policy updates are calculated using the ** surrogate objective function**, which measures the difference between the estimated rewards and the actual rewards.\n",
      "3. To minimize the loss, the policy update is applied iteratively, allowing the agent to learn from its mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example: Playing Pong with PPO**\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you're playing Pong on a computer. You need to use your paddle to hit a ball back and forth. 🏀\n",
      "\n",
      "* The agent observes the current state of the game (e.g., position of the ball).\n",
      "* It decides which action (left or right) to take.\n",
      "* The policy updates are calculated using the surrogate objective function, which measures the difference between the estimated rewards (e.g., points scored by you vs. your opponent).\n",
      "* To minimize the loss, the policy update is applied iteratively.\n",

      "🤔 **The Power of Stochastic Actor-Critic**\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to PPO, SAC uses a different approach to learn from experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The agent observes the current state and decides an action.\n",
      "2. The value function estimates the expected cumulative reward from taking that action in an episode.\n",
      "3. To optimize the policy, SAC updates both the action and value functions simultaneously.\n",

a\\nmathematician\\n,\\nphysicist\\n,\\nastronomer\\n,\\nalchemist\\n,\\ntheologian\\n, and author.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nNewton was a key figure in the\\nScientific Revolution\\nand the\\nEnlightenment\\nthat followed.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nHis book\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\n(\\nMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\n), first published in 1687, achieved the\\nfirst great unification in physics\\nand established\\nclassical mechanics\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nNewton also made seminal contributions to\\noptics\\n, and\\nshares credit\\nwith German mathematician\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nfor formulating\\ninfinitesimal calculus\\n, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nHe contributed to and refined the\\nscientific method\\n, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn the\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton formulated the\\nlaws of motion\\nand\\nuniversal gravitation\\nthat formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the\\ntheory of relativity\\n. He used his mathematical description of\\ngravity\\nto derive\\nKepler\\'s laws of planetary motion\\n, account for\\ntides\\n, the\\ntrajectories\\nof\\ncomets\\n, the\\nprecession of the equinoxes\\nand other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the\\nSolar System\\n\\'s\\nheliocentricity\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nNewton solved the\\ntwo-body problem\\n, and introduced the\\nthree-body problem\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nHe demonstrated that the\\nmotion of objects\\non Earth and\\ncelestial bodies\\ncould be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\\'s inference that the Earth is an\\noblate spheroid\\nwas later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of\\nMaupertuis\\n,\\nLa Condamine\\n, and others, thereby convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\\nNewton built the\\nfirst reflecting telescope\\nand developed a sophisticated\\ntheory of colour\\nbased on the observation that a\\nprism\\nseparates\\nwhite light\\ninto the colours of the\\nvisible spectrum\\n. His work on light was collected in his book\\nOpticks\\n, published in 1704. He originated prisms as\\nbeam expanders\\nand\\nmultiple-prism arrays\\n, which would later become integral to the development of\\ntunable lasers\\n.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nNewton also formulated an\\nempirical law of cooling\\n, which was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of\\nconvective heat transfer\\n,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nmade the first theoretical calculation of the\\nspeed of sound\\n, and introduced the notions of a\\nNewtonian fluid\\nand a\\nblack body\\n. Furthermore, he made early investigations into\\nelectricity\\n,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nwith an idea from his book\\nOpticks\\narguably the beginning of the\\nfield theory of the electric force\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn addition to his creation of calculus, as a mathematician, he generalized the\\nbinomial theorem\\nto any real number, contributed to the study of\\npower series\\n, developed\\na method\\nfor approximating the\\nroots of a function\\n, classified most of the\\ncubic plane curves\\n, and also originated the\\nNewton-Cotes formulas\\nfor\\nnumerical integration\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nHe further initiated the field of\\ncalculus of variations\\n,\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nand devised an early form of\\nregression analysis\\n.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nNewton was a fellow of\\nTrinity College\\nand the second\\nLucasian Professor of Mathematics\\nat the\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\n; he was appointed at the age of 26. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the\\nTrinity\\n. He refused to take\\nholy orders\\nin the\\nChurch of England\\n, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the\\nmathematical sciences\\n, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of\\nalchemy\\nand\\nbiblical chronology\\n, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the\\nWhig party\\n, Newton served two brief terms as\\nMember of Parliament for the University of Cambridge\\n, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. He was\\nknighted\\nby\\nQueen Anne\\nin 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as\\nWarden\\n(1696–1699) and\\nMaster\\n(1699–1727) of the\\nRoyal Mint\\n, in which he increased the accuracy and security of British coinage,\\n[\\n26\\n]\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nas well as president of the\\nRoyal Society\\n(1703–1727).\\nEarly life\\nMain article:\\nEarly life of Isaac Newton\\nIsaac Newton was born (according to the\\nJulian calendar\\nin use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (\\nNS\\n4 January 1643\\n[\\na\\n]\\n) at\\nWoolsthorpe Manor\\nin\\nWoolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth\\n, a\\nhamlet\\nin the county of Lincolnshire.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.\\nBorn prematurely\\n, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a\\nquart\\nmug.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nWhen Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\"\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nNewton\\'s mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nThe King\\'s School\\nFrom the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at\\nThe King\\'s School\\nin\\nGrantham\\n, which taught\\nLatin\\nand\\nAncient Greek\\nand probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nHe was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nHenry Stokes, master at The King\\'s School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,\\n[\\n34\\n]\\ndistinguishing himself mainly by building\\nsundials\\nand models of windmills.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\nIn June 1661, Newton was admitted to\\nTrinity College\\nat the\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\n. His uncle the Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a\\nsubsizar\\n, paying his way by performing\\nvalet\\nduties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his\\nMA\\n.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAt the time, Cambridge\\'s teachings were based on those of\\nAristotle\\n, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including\\nDescartes\\nand\\nastronomers\\nsuch as\\nGalileo Galilei\\nand\\nThomas Street\\n. He set down in his notebook a series of \"\\nQuaestiones\\n\" about\\nmechanical philosophy\\nas he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised\\nbinomial theorem\\nand began to develop a mathematical theory that later became\\ncalculus\\n. Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the\\nGreat Plague\\n.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nAlthough he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, his private studies and the years following his bachelor\\'s degree have been described as \"the richest and most productive ever experienced by a scientist\".\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nThe next two years alone saw the development of theories on calculus,\\n[\\n39\\n]\\noptics\\n, and the\\nlaw of gravitation\\n, at his home in Woolsthorpe. The physicist Louis T. More stated that \"There are no other examples of achievement in the history of science to compare with that of Newton during those two golden years.\"\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nNewton has been described as an \"exceptionally organized\" person when it came to note-taking, further dog-earing pages he saw as important. Furthermore, Newton\\'s \"indexes look like present-day indexes: They are alphabetical, by topic.\" His books showed his interests to be wide-ranging, with Newton himself described as a \"Janusian thinker, someone who could mix and combine seemingly disparate fields to stimulate creative breakthroughs.\"\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nIn April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nFellows were required to take\\nholy orders\\nand be ordained as\\nAnglican\\npriests, although this was not enforced in the\\nRestoration\\nyears, and an assertion of conformity to the\\nChurch of England\\nwas sufficient. He made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7\\xa0years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.\"\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nUp until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the\\nThirty-nine Articles\\n, the basis of Church of England doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nHis academic work impressed the\\nLucasian Professor\\nIsaac Barrow\\n, who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King\\nCharles II\\n, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a conflict between Newton\\'s religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nHe was appointed at the age of 26.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nSome of the figures added by Isaac Newton in his 1672 and 1681 editions of the\\nGeographia Generalis\\n. These figures appeared in subsequent editions as well.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nThe Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge position included the responsibility of instructing\\ngeography\\n.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nIn 1672, and again in 1681, Newton published a revised, corrected, and amended edition of the\\nGeographia Generalis\\n, a geography textbook first published in 1650 by the then-deceased\\nBernhardus Varenius\\n.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nIn the\\nGeographia Generalis,\\nVarenius attempted to create a theoretical foundation linking scientific principles to classical concepts in geography, and considered geography to be a mix between science and pure mathematics applied to quantifying features of the Earth.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nWhile it is unclear if Newton ever lectured in geography, the 1733 Dugdale and Shaw English translation of the book stated Newton published the book to be read by students while he lectured on the subject.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nThe\\nGeographia Generalis\\nis viewed by some as the dividing line between ancient and modern traditions in the\\nhistory of geography\\n, and Newton\\'s involvement in the subsequent editions is thought to be a large part of the reason for this enduring legacy.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nNewton was elected a\\nFellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nMid-life\\nCalculus\\nNewton\\'s work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\".\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nHis work on calculus, usually referred to as fluxions, began in 1664, and by May 20, 1665 as seen in a manuscript, Newton \"had already developed the calculus to the point where he could compute the tangent and the curvature at any point of a continuous curve\".\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nAnother manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton\\'s mathematical papers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nHis work\\nDe analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas\\n, sent by\\nIsaac Barrow\\nto\\nJohn Collins\\nin June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nNewton later\\nbecame involved in a dispute\\nwith\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nover priority in the development of calculus. Both are now credited with independently developing calculus, though with very different\\nmathematical notations\\n. However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nLeibniz\\'s notation is recognized as the more convenient notation, being adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820, by British mathematicians.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nHistorian of science\\nA. Rupert Hall\\nnotes that while Leibniz deserves credit for his independent formulation of calculus, Newton was undoubtedly the first to develop it, stating:\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBut all these matters are of little weight in comparison with the central truth, which has indeed long been universally recognized, that Newton was master of the essential techniques of the calculus by the end of 1666, almost exactly nine years before Leibniz . . . Newton’s claim to have mastered the new infinitesimal calculus long before Leibniz, and even to have written — or at least made a good start upon — a publishable exposition of it as early as 1671, is certainly borne out by copious evidence, and though Leibniz and some of his friends sought to belittle Newton’s case, the truth has not been seriously in doubt for the last 250 years.\\nHall further notes that in\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton was able to \"formulate and resolve problems by the integration of differential equations\" and \"in fact, he anticipated in his book many results that later exponents of the calculus regarded as their own novel achievements.\"\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nIt has been noted that despite the convenience of Leibniz\\'s notation, Newton\\'s notation could still have been used to develop multivariate techniques, with his dot notation still widely used in\\nphysics\\n. Some academics have noted the richness and depth of Newton\\'s work, such as physicist\\nRoger Penrose\\n, stating \"in most cases Newton’s geometrical methods are not only more concise and elegant, they reveal deeper principles than would become evident by the use of those formal methods of calculus that nowadays would seem more direct.\" Mathematician\\nVladimir Arnold\\nstates \"Comparing the texts of Newton with the comments of his successors, it is striking how Newton’s original presentation is more modern, more understandable and richer in ideas than the translation due to commentators of his geometrical ideas into the formal language of the calculus of Leibniz.\"\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nHis work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the\\nPrincipia\\nitself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\"\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nand explained why he put his expositions in this form,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nremarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nBecause of this, the\\nPrincipia\\nhas been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nand in Newton\\'s time \"nearly all of it is of this calculus.\"\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nHis use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in his\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum\\nof 1684\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nand in his papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nNewton in 1702 by\\nGodfrey Kneller\\nNewton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nHe was close to the Swiss mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton\\'s\\nPrincipia\\n, and corresponded with Leibniz.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nIn 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nStarting in 1699, Duillier accused Leibniz of plagiarism.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nMathematician\\nJohn Keill\\naccused Leibniz of plagiarism in 1708 in the Royal Society journal, thereby deteriorating the situation even more.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nThe dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study\\'s concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both men until Leibniz\\'s death in 1716.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nNewton is credited with the\\ngeneralised binomial theorem\\n, valid for any exponent. He discovered\\nNewton\\'s identities\\n,\\nNewton\\'s method\\n, classified\\ncubic plane curves\\n(\\npolynomials\\nof degree three in two\\nvariables\\n), made substantial contributions to the theory of\\nfinite differences\\n, with Newton regarded as \"the single most significant contributor to finite difference\\ninterpolation\\n\", with many formulas created by Newton.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nHe was the first to state\\nBézout\\'s theorem\\n, and was also the first to use fractional indices and to employ\\ncoordinate geometry\\nto derive solutions to\\nDiophantine equations\\n. He approximated\\npartial\\nsums of the\\nharmonic series\\nby\\nlogarithms\\n(a precursor to\\nEuler\\'s summation formula\\n) and was the first to use\\npower series\\nwith confidence and to revert power series. He originated the\\nNewton-Cotes formulas\\nfor\\nnumerical integration\\n. His work on infinite series was inspired by\\nSimon Stevin\\n\\'s decimals.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nHe also initiated the field of\\ncalculus of variations\\n, being the first to clearly formulate and correctly solve a problem in the field, that being\\nNewton\\'s minimal resistance problem\\n, which he posed and solved in 1685, and then later published in\\nPrincipia\\nin 1687.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nIt is regarded as one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century.\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nHe then used calculus of variations in his solving of the\\nbrachistochrone curve\\nproblem in 1697, which was posed by\\nJohann Bernoulli\\nin 1696, thus he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nOptics\\nA replica of the reflecting telescope Newton presented to the\\nRoyal Society\\nin 1672 (the first one he made in 1668 was loaned to an instrument maker but there is no further record of what happened to it).\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a\\nprism\\nin the position of\\nminimum deviation\\nis oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.\\n[\\n79\\n]\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nThis led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.\\nFrom 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nDuring this period he investigated the\\nrefraction\\nof light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a\\nspectrum\\n, could be recomposed into white light by a\\nlens\\nand a second prism.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nModern scholarship has revealed that Newton\\'s analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to\\ncorpuscular\\nalchemy.\\n[\\n83\\n]\\nIn his work on\\nNewton\\'s rings\\nin 1671, he used a method that was unprecedented in the 17th century, as \"he\\naveraged\\nall of the differences, and he then calculated the difference between the average and the value for the first ring\", in effect introducing a now\\nstandard method\\nfor reducing noise in measurements, and which does not appear elsewhere at the time.\\n[\\n84\\n]\\nHe extended his \"error-slaying method\" to studies of equinoxes in 1700, which was described as an \"altogether unprecedented method\" but differed in that here \"Newton required good values for each of the original equinoctial times, and so he devised a method that allowed them to, as it were, self-correct.\"\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nNewton is credited with introducing \"an embryonic linear\\nregression analysis\\n\", as he averaged a set of data, 50 years before\\nTobias Mayer\\n, and also \"summing the residuals to zero he\\nforced\\nthe regression line to pass through the average point\". He also \"distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an\\noptimal\\nsolution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness\".\\n[\\n85\\n]\\nHe showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as\\nNewton\\'s theory of colour\\n.\\n[\\n86\\n]\\nIllustration of a\\ndispersive prism\\nseparating white light into the colours of the spectrum, as discovered by Newton\\nFrom this work, he concluded that the lens of any\\nrefracting telescope\\nwould suffer from the\\ndispersion\\nof light into colours (\\nchromatic aberration\\n). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the\\nobjective\\nto bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a\\nNewtonian telescope\\n, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique.\\n[\\n87\\n]\\nHe grounded his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective\\nspeculum metal\\n, using Newton\\'s rings to judge the\\nquality\\nof the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,\\n[\\n88\\n]\\nhe was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, he was asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope by the Royal Society.\\n[\\n89\\n]\\nTheir interest encouraged him to publish his notes,\\nOf Colours\\n,\\n[\\n90\\n]\\nwhich he later expanded into the work\\nOpticks\\n. When\\nRobert Hooke\\ncriticised some of Newton\\'s ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. However, the two had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society,\\n[\\n91\\n]\\nopened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,\\n[\\n92\\n]\\nwhich had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. The two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke\\'s death.\\n[\\n93\\n]\\nFacsimile of a 1682 letter from Newton to\\nWilliam Briggs\\n, commenting on Briggs\\'\\nA New Theory of Vision\\nNewton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (\\nOpticks\\nBk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of \\'fits\\' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). Physicists later favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the\\ninterference\\npatterns and the general phenomenon of\\ndiffraction\\n. Despite his known preference of a particle theory, Newton in fact noted that light had both particle-like and wave-like properties in\\nOpticks\\n, and was the first to attempt to reconcile the two theories, thereby anticipating later developments of\\nwave-particle duality\\n, which is the modern understanding of light.\\n[\\n94\\n]\\nIn his\\nHypothesis of Light\\nof 1675, Newton posited the existence of the\\nether\\nto transmit forces between particles. The contact with the\\nCambridge Platonist\\nphilosopher\\nHenry More\\nrevived his interest in alchemy.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nHe replaced the ether with occult forces based on\\nHermetic\\nideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. His contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nThis was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.\\n[\\n96\\n]\\n[\\n97\\n]\\nIn 1704, Newton published\\nOpticks\\n, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light, and included a set of queries at the end, which were posed as unanswered questions and positive assertions. In line with his corpuscle theory, he thought that normal matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation, with query 30 stating \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"\\n[\\n98\\n]\\nQuery 6 introduced the concept of a\\nblack body\\n.\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nNewton investigated\\nelectricity\\nby constructing a primitive form of a frictional\\nelectrostatic generator\\nusing a glass globe,\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nand detailed an experiment in 1675 that showed when one side of a glass sheet is rubbed to create an electric charge, it attracts \"light bodies\" to the opposite side. He interpreted this as evidence that electric forces could pass through glass.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHis idea in\\nOpticks\\nthat optical reflection and refraction arise from interactions across the entire surface is regarded as the beginning of the field theory of electric force.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nHis mass-dispersion model, ancestral to the successful use of the\\nleast action principle\\n, provided a credible framework for understanding refraction, particularly in its approach to refraction in terms of momentum.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn\\nOpticks\\n, he was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton\\'s discussion,\\nmultiple-prism beam expanders\\nbecame central to the development of\\nnarrow-linewidth\\ntunable lasers\\n. The use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the\\nmultiple-prism dispersion theory\\n.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nSubsequent to Newton, much has been amended.\\nThomas Young\\nand\\nAugustin-Jean Fresnel\\ndiscarded Newton\\'s particle theory in favour of\\nChristiaan Huygens\\n\\' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light\\'s wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist,\\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\\n, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton\\'s armour,\\xa0... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by\\nDollond\\nto be wrong.\"\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nEngraving of\\nPortrait of Newton\\nby\\nJohn Vanderbank\\nGravity\\nNewton\\'s own copy of\\nPrincipia\\nwith Newton\\'s hand-written corrections for the second edition, now housed in the\\nWren Library\\nat\\nTrinity College, Cambridge\\nNewton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665.\\n[\\n105\\n]\\nIn 1679, he returned to his work on\\ncelestial mechanics\\nby considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of\\nplanets\\nwith reference to\\nKepler\\'s laws\\nof planetary motion. Newton\\'s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with\\nJohn Flamsteed\\n.\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nAfter the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. He communicated his results to\\nEdmond Halley\\nand to the Royal Society in\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum\\n, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society\\'s Register Book in December 1684.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\nThis tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the\\nPrincipia\\n.\\nThe\\nPrincipia\\nwas published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton stated the\\nthree universal laws of motion\\n. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for\\nclassical mechanics\\n. They contributed to many advances during the\\nIndustrial Revolution\\nwhich soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word\\ngravitas\\n(weight) for the effect that would become known as\\ngravity\\n, and defined the law of\\nuniversal gravitation\\n.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nHis work achieved the\\nfirst great unification in physics\\n.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nHe further solved the\\ntwo-body problem\\n, and introduced the\\nthree-body problem\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIn the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using \\'first and last ratios\\', gave the first analytical determination (based on\\nBoyle\\'s law\\n) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth\\'s spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon\\'s gravitational attraction on the Earth\\'s oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the\\nirregularities in the motion of the Moon\\n, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nNewton\\'s biographer\\nDavid Brewster\\nreported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton\\'s health: \"[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep\" during his work on the problem in 1692–93, and told the astronomer\\nJohn Machin\\nthat \"his head never ached but when he was studying the subject\". According to Brewster, Halley also told\\nJohn Conduitt\\nthat when pressed to complete his analysis Newton \"always replied that it made his head ache, and\\nkept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more\\n\". [Emphasis in original]\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nNewton made clear his\\nheliocentric\\nview of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nFor Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem\\'d the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\". (Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.)\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nNewton was criticised for introducing \"\\noccult\\nagencies\" into science because of his postulate of an invisible\\nforce able to act over vast distances\\n.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nLater, in the second edition of the\\nPrincipia\\n(1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding\\nGeneral Scholium\\n, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here he used what became his famous expression\\n\"\\nHypotheses non fingo\\n\"\\n.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\n)\\nWith the\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton became internationally recognised.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nHe acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nIn the 1660s and 1670s, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types, systemizing his results in later publications. However, a 1690s manuscript later analyzed showed that Newton had identified all 78 cubic curves, but chose not to publish the remaining six for unknown reasons.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIn 1717, and probably with Newton\\'s help,\\nJames Stirling\\nproved that every cubic was one of these four types. He claimed that the four types could be obtained by\\nplane projection\\nfrom one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nOther significant work\\nNewton studied heat and energy flow, formulating an\\nempirical law of cooling\\nwhich states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surrounding environment. It was first formulated in 1701, and is the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of\\nconvective heat transfer\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nNewton introduced the notion of a\\nNewtonian fluid\\nwith his formulation of his\\nlaw of viscosity\\nin\\nPrincipia\\nin 1687. It states that the shear stress between two fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradient between them.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPhilosophy of Science\\nStarting with the second edition of his\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method. It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, \"hypotheses non fingo\", which can be translated as \"I don\\'t make hypotheses,\" (the direct translation of \"fingo\" is \"frame\", but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science). He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation. The quote in part as translated is, \"Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nNewton contributed to and refined the\\nscientific method\\n. In his work on the properties of light in the 1670s, he showed his rigorous method, which was conducting experiments, taking detailed notes, making measurements, conducting more experiments that grew out of the initial ones, he formulated a theory, created more experiments to test it, and finally described the entire process so other scientists could replicate every step.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nIn his 1687\\nPrincipia\\n, he outlined four rules: the first is, \\'Admit no more causes of natural things than are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances\\'; the second is, \\'To the same natural effect, assign the same causes\\'; the third is, \\'Qualities of bodies, which are found to belong to all bodies within experiments, are to be esteemed universal\\'; and lastly, \\'Propositions collected from observation of phenomena should be viewed as accurate or very nearly true until contradicted by other phenomena\\'. These rules have become the basis of the modern approaches to science.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nLater life\\nFurther information:\\nLater life of Isaac Newton\\nRoyal Mint\\nIsaac Newton in old age in 1712, portrait by\\nSir James Thornhill\\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of\\nreligious tracts\\ndealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to\\nJohn Locke\\nin which he disputed the fidelity of\\n1 John 5:7\\n—the\\nJohannine Comma\\n—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nNewton was also a member of the\\nParliament of England\\nfor\\nCambridge University\\nin 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nHe was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist\\nAbraham de la Pryme\\nto have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nNewton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the\\nRoyal Mint\\nduring the reign of\\nKing William III\\nin 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of\\nCharles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax\\n, then\\nChancellor of the Exchequer\\n. He took charge of England\\'s great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy\\ncomptroller\\nof the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known\\nMaster of the Mint\\nupon the death of\\nThomas Neale\\nin 1699, a position he held for the last 30\\xa0years of his life.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nThese appointments were intended as\\nsinecures\\n, but Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish\\nclippers\\nand counterfeiters.\\nAs Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20\\xa0percent of the coins taken in during the\\nGreat Recoinage of 1696\\nwere\\ncounterfeit\\n. Counterfeiting was\\nhigh treason\\n, punishable by the felon being\\nhanged, drawn and quartered\\n. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nDisguised as a\\nhabitué\\nof bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself.\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nFor all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government,\\nEnglish law\\nstill had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a\\njustice of the peace\\nin all the\\nhome counties\\n. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton\\'s personal first edition of\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\n, which he must have been amending at the time.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nThen he conducted more than 100\\xa0cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He successfully prosecuted 28\\xa0coiners, including serial counterfeiter\\nWilliam Chaloner\\n, who was subsequently hanged.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\nBeyond prosecuting counterfeiters, he improved minting technology and reduced the standard deviation of the weight of guineas from 1.3 grams to 0.75 grams. Starting in 1707, Newton introduced the practice of testing a small sample of coins, a pound in weight, in the\\ntrial of the pyx\\n, which helped to reduce the size of admissible error. He ultimately saved the Treasury a then £41,510, roughly £3 million in 2012,\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nwith his improvements lasting until the 1770s, thereby increasing the accuracy of British coinage.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nCoat of arms\\nof the Newton family of\\nGreat Gonerby\\n, Lincolnshire, afterwards used by Sir Isaac\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nNewton was made president of the\\nRoyal Society\\nin 1703 and an associate of the French\\nAcadémie des Sciences\\n. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of\\nJohn Flamsteed\\n, the\\nAstronomer Royal\\n, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed\\'s\\nHistoria Coelestis Britannica\\n, which Newton had used in his studies.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nKnighthood\\nIn April 1705, Queen Anne\\nknighted\\nNewton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the\\nparliamentary election in May 1705\\n, rather than any recognition of Newton\\'s scientific work or services as Master of the Mint.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\nNewton was the second scientist to be knighted, after\\nFrancis Bacon\\n.\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nAs a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty\\'s Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21\\xa0silver shillings.\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nThis inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the\\nsilver standard\\nto its first\\ngold standard\\n. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\nIt has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nNewton was invested in the\\nSouth Sea Company\\nand lost some £20,000 (£4.4\\xa0million in 2020\\n[\\n136\\n]\\n) when it collapsed in around 1720.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nToward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at\\nCranbury Park\\n, near\\nWinchester\\n, with his niece and her husband, until his death.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nHis half-niece,\\nCatherine Barton\\n,\\n[\\n139\\n]\\nserved as his hostess in social affairs at his house on\\nJermyn Street\\nin London; he was her \"very loving Uncle\",\\n[\\n140\\n]\\naccording to his letter to her when she was recovering from\\nsmallpox\\n.\\nDeath\\nDeath mask of Newton, photographed\\nc.\\n1906\\nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (\\nOS\\n20 March 1726;\\nNS\\n31 March 1727).\\n[\\na\\n]\\nHe was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in\\nWestminster Abbey\\namong kings and queens.

The French writer and philosopher\\nVoltaire\\n, who was in London at the time of Newton\\'s funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.”\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nThere exists a widespread belief that Newton died a\\nvirgin\\n, and writers as diverse as mathematician\\nCharles Hutton\\n,\\n[\\n150\\n]\\neconomist\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n,\\n[\\n151\\n]\\nand physicist\\nCarl Sagan\\nhave commented on it.\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nNewton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n, whom he met in London around 1689;\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nsome of their correspondence has survived.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nTheir relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a\\nnervous breakdown\\n,\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nwhich included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends\\nSamuel Pepys\\nand\\nJohn Locke\\n. His note to the latter included the charge that Locke had endeavoured to \"embroil\" him with \"woemen & by other means\".\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nNewton appeared to be relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a later memoir, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nNonetheless, he could be fiercely competitive and did on occasion hold grudges against his intellectual rivals, not abstaining from personal attacks when it suited him—a common trait found in many of his contemporaries.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nIn a letter to\\nRobert Hooke\\nin February 1676, for instance, he confessed \"If I have seen further it is by\\nstanding on the shoulders of giants\\n.\"\\n[\\n159\\n]\\nSome historians argued that this, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were disputing over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke who was presumably short and hunchbacked, rather than (or in addition to) a statement of modesty.\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nOn the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, found in 17th century poet\\nGeorge Herbert\\n\\'s\\nJacula Prudentum\\n(1651) among others, had as its main point that \"a dwarf on a giant\\'s shoulders sees farther of the two\", and so in effect place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the \\'dwarf\\' who saw farther.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nTheology\\nReligious views\\nMain articles:\\nReligious views of Isaac Newton\\nand\\nIsaac Newton\\'s occult studies\\nAlthough born into an\\nAnglican\\nfamily, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity,\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nwith historian\\nStephen Snobelen\\nlabelling him a\\nheretic\\n.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nBy 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972.\\n[\\n164\\n]\\nOver half of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and most has never been printed.\\n[\\n164\\n]\\nHis writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of\\nearly Church\\nwritings and show that in the conflict between\\nAthanasius\\nand\\nArius\\nwhich defined the\\nCreed\\n, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the\\nTrinity\\n. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.\"\\n[\\n165\\n]\\nHe was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, \"the\\ngreat apostasy\\nwas trinitarianism.\"\\n[\\n166\\n]\\nNewton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.\\n[\\n167\\n]\\nWorshipping\\nJesus Christ\\nas\\nGod\\nwas, in Newton\\'s eyes,\\nidolatry\\n, an act he believed to be the fundamental\\nsin\\n.\\n[\\n168\\n]\\nIn 1999, Snobelen wrote, that\"Isaac Newton was a\\nheretic\\n. But\\xa0... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs.\" Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a\\nSocinian\\nsympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an\\nArian\\nand almost certainly an\\nanti-trinitarian\\n.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nNewton\\n(1795, detail) by\\nWilliam Blake\\n. Newton is depicted critically as a \"divine geometer\".\\n[\\n169\\n]\\nAlthough the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\\'s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, \"So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun\".\\n[\\n170\\n]\\nAlong with his scientific fame, Newton\\'s studies of the Bible and of the early\\nChurch Fathers\\nwere also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on\\ntextual criticism\\n, most notably\\nAn Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture\\nand\\nObservations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John\\n.\\n[\\n171\\n]\\nHe placed the crucifixion of\\nJesus Christ\\nat 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.\\n[\\n172\\n]\\nHe believed in a rationally\\nimmanent\\nworld, but he rejected the\\nhylozoism\\nimplicit in\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nand\\nBaruch Spinoza\\n. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, he claimed that in writing the\\nPrincipia\\n\"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\".\\n[\\n173\\n]\\nHe saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.\\n[\\n174\\n]\\nFor this, Leibniz lampooned him: \"God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"\\n[\\n175\\n]\\nNewton\\'s position was defended by his follower\\nSamuel Clarke\\nin a\\nfamous correspondence\\n. A century later,\\nPierre-Simon Laplace\\n\\'s work\\nCelestial Mechanics\\nhad a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.\\n[\\n176\\n]\\nThe contrast between Laplace\\'s mechanistic worldview and Newton\\'s one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave\\nNapoleon\\n, who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the\\nMécanique céleste\\n: \"Sire, j\\'ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse\" (\"Sir, I didn\\'t need this hypothesis\").\\n[\\n177\\n]\\nScholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the\\nTrinity\\n. His first biographer,\\nDavid Brewster\\n, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.\\n[\\n178\\n]\\nIn the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n(among others) were deciphered\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nand it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nReligious thought\\nNewton and\\nRobert Boyle\\n\\'s approach to the\\nmechanical philosophy\\nwas promoted by\\nrationalist\\npamphleteers as a viable alternative to the\\npantheists\\nand\\nenthusiasts\\n, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the\\nlatitudinarians\\n.\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nThe clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and\\nmetaphysical\\nsuperlatives of both\\nsuperstitious\\nenthusiasm and the threat of\\natheism\\n,\\n[\\n181\\n]\\nand at the same time, the second wave of English\\ndeists\\nused Newton\\'s discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\".\\nThe attacks made against pre-\\nEnlightenment\\n\"\\nmagical thinking\\n\", and the\\nmystical elements of Christianity\\n, were given their foundation with Boyle\\'s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle\\'s ideas their completion through\\nmathematical proofs\\nand, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nAlchemy\\nNewton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child born with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage.\\n–\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n, \"Newton, the Man\"\\n[\\n183\\n]\\nOf an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton\\'s papers, about one million deal with\\nalchemy\\n.

Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton\\'s involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, \"chymistry.\"\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nIn June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton\\'s notes on\\nJan Baptist van Helmont\\n\\'s book on plague,\\nDe Peste\\n,\\n[\\n189\\n]\\nwere being auctioned online by\\nBonhams\\n. Newton\\'s analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London\\'s 1665–1666\\ninfection\\n, is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that \"the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison\".\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nLegacy\\nSee also:\\nIsaac Newton in popular culture\\nRecognition\\nNewton\\'s tomb monument in\\nWestminster Abbey\\nby\\nJohn Michael Rysbrack\\nThe mathematician and astronomer\\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange\\nfrequently asserted that Newton was the greatest\\ngenius\\nwho ever lived,\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nand once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\"\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nEnglish poet\\nAlexander Pope\\nwrote the famous\\nepitaph\\n:\\nNature, and Nature\\'s laws lay hid in night.\\nGod said,\\nLet Newton be!\\nand all was light.\\nBut this was not allowed to be inscribed in Newton\\'s monument at Westminster.

MDCCXXVI,\\nwhich can be translated as follows:\\n[\\n193\\n]\\nHere is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25th December 1642, and died on 20th March 1726.\\nNewton has been called \"the most influential figure in the history of Western science\",\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nand has been regarded as \"the central figure in the history of science\", who \"more than anyone else is the source of our great confidence in the power of science.\"\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nNew Scientist\\ncalled Newton \"the supreme genius and most enigmatic character in the history of science\".\\n[\\n196\\n]\\nThe philosopher and historian\\nDavid Hume\\nalso declared that Newton was \"the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species\".\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nIn his home of\\nMonticello\\n,\\nThomas Jefferson\\n, a\\nFounding Father\\nand\\nPresident of the United States\\n, kept portraits of\\nJohn Locke\\n,\\nSir Francis Bacon\\n, and Newton, whom he described as \"the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception\", and who he credited with laying \"the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".\\n[\\n198\\n]\\nNewton has further been called \"the towering figure of the\\nScientific Revolution\\n\" and that \"In a period rich with outstanding thinkers, Newton was simply the most outstanding.\" The polymath\\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\\nlabeled Newton\\'s birth as the \"\\nChristmas\\nof the modern age\".\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nIn the Italian polymath\\nVilfredo Pareto\\n\\'s estimation, Newton was the greatest human being who ever lived.\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nOn the bicentennial of Newton\\'s death in 1927, astronomer\\nJames Jeans\\nstated that he \"was certainly the greatest man of science, and perhaps the greatest intellect, the human race has seen\".\\n[\\n200\\n]\\nNewton ultimately conceived four revolutions—in optics, mathematics, mechanics, and gravity—but also foresaw a fifth in electricity, though he lacked the time and energy in old age to fully accomplish it.\\n[\\n201\\n]\\n[\\n202\\n]\\nThe physicist\\nLudwig Boltzmann\\ncalled Newton\\'s\\nPrincipia\\n\"the first and greatest work ever written about\\ntheoretical physics\\n\".\\n[\\n203\\n]\\nPhysicist\\nStephen Hawking\\nsimilarly called\\nPrincipia\\n\"probably the most important single work ever published in the\\nphysical sciences\\n\".\\n[\\n204\\n]\\nLagrange called\\nPrincipia\\n\"the greatest production of the human mind\", and noted that \"he felt dazed at such an illustration of what man\\'s intellect might be capable\".\\n[\\n205\\n]\\nPhysicist\\nEdward Andrade\\nstated that Newton \"was capable of greater sustained mental effort than any man, before or since\", and noted earlier the place of Isaac Newton in history, stating:\\n[\\n206\\n]\\nFrom time to time in the history of mankind a man arises who is of universal significance, whose work changes the current of human thought or of human experience, so that all that comes after him bears evidence of his spirit. Such a man was\\nShakespeare\\n, such a man was\\nBeethoven\\n, such a man was Newton, and, of the three, his kingdom is the most widespread.\\nThe French physicist and mathematician\\nJean-Baptiste Biot\\npraised Newton\\'s genius, stating that:\\n[\\n207\\n]\\nNever was the supremacy of intellect so justly established and so fully confessed . . . In mathematical and in experimental science without an equal and without an example; combining the genius for both in its highest degree.\\nDespite his rivalry with\\nGottfried Wilhem Leibniz\\n, Leibniz still praised the work of Newton, with him responding to a question at a dinner in 1701 from\\nSophia Charlotte\\n, the Queen of Prussia, about his view of Newton with:\\n[\\n208\\n]\\n[\\n209\\n]\\nTaking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time of when Newton lived, what he had done was much the better half.\\nMathematician\\nE.T.

Stukeley recorded in his\\nMemoirs of Sir Isaac Newton\\'s Life\\na conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:\\n[\\n232\\n]\\n[\\n233\\n]\\nwe went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. \"why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,\" thought he to him self: occasion\\'d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: \"why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.\"\\nJohn Conduitt\\n, Newton\\'s assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton\\'s niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton\\'s life:\\n[\\n234\\n]\\nIn the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.\\nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory.\\n[\\n235\\n]\\nThe question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon\\'s orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\".\\nVarious trees are claimed to be \"the\" apple tree which Newton describes. The\\nKing\\'s School, Grantham\\nclaims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster\\'s garden some years later. The staff of the (now)\\nNational Trust\\n-owned\\nWoolsthorpe Manor\\ndispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree\\n[\\n236\\n]\\ncan be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The\\nNational Fruit Collection\\nat\\nBrogdale\\nin Kent\\n[\\n237\\n]\\ncan supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to\\nFlower of Kent\\n, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.\\n[\\n238\\n]\\nCommemorations\\nNewton statue on display at the\\nOxford University Museum of Natural History\\nNewton\\'s monument (1731) can be seen in\\nWestminster Abbey\\n, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor\\nMichael Rysbrack\\n(1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect\\nWilliam Kent\\n.\\n[\\n239\\n]\\nThe monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts\\nputti\\nusing instruments such as a telescope and prism.\\n[\\n240\\n]\\nFrom 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1\\nbanknotes\\nissued by the\\nBank of England\\n(the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England).

a\\nmathematician\\n,\\nphysicist\\n,\\nastronomer\\n,\\nalchemist\\n,\\ntheologian\\n, and author.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nNewton was a key figure in the\\nScientific Revolution\\nand the\\nEnlightenment\\nthat followed.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nHis book\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\n(\\nMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\n), first published in 1687, achieved the\\nfirst great unification in physics\\nand established\\nclassical mechanics\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nNewton also made seminal contributions to\\noptics\\n, and\\nshares credit\\nwith German mathematician\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nfor formulating\\ninfinitesimal calculus\\n, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nHe contributed to and refined the\\nscientific method\\n, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn the\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton formulated the\\nlaws of motion\\nand\\nuniversal gravitation\\nthat formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the\\ntheory of relativity\\n. He used his mathematical description of\\ngravity\\nto derive\\nKepler\\'s laws of planetary motion\\n, account for\\ntides\\n, the\\ntrajectories\\nof\\ncomets\\n, the\\nprecession of the equinoxes\\nand other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the\\nSolar System\\n\\'s\\nheliocentricity\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nNewton solved the\\ntwo-body problem\\n, and introduced the\\nthree-body problem\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nHe demonstrated that the\\nmotion of objects\\non Earth and\\ncelestial bodies\\ncould be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\\'s inference that the Earth is an\\noblate spheroid\\nwas later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of\\nMaupertuis\\n,\\nLa Condamine\\n, and others, thereby convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\\nNewton built the\\nfirst reflecting telescope\\nand developed a sophisticated\\ntheory of colour\\nbased on the observation that a\\nprism\\nseparates\\nwhite light\\ninto the colours of the\\nvisible spectrum\\n. His work on light was collected in his book\\nOpticks\\n, published in 1704. He originated prisms as\\nbeam expanders\\nand\\nmultiple-prism arrays\\n, which would later become integral to the development of\\ntunable lasers\\n.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nNewton also formulated an\\nempirical law of cooling\\n, which was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of\\nconvective heat transfer\\n,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nmade the first theoretical calculation of the\\nspeed of sound\\n, and introduced the notions of a\\nNewtonian fluid\\nand a\\nblack body\\n. Furthermore, he made early investigations into\\nelectricity\\n,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nwith an idea from his book\\nOpticks\\narguably the beginning of the\\nfield theory of the electric force\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn addition to his creation of calculus, as a mathematician, he generalized the\\nbinomial theorem\\nto any real number, contributed to the study of\\npower series\\n, developed\\na method\\nfor approximating the\\nroots of a function\\n, classified most of the\\ncubic plane curves\\n, and also originated the\\nNewton-Cotes formulas\\nfor\\nnumerical integration\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nHe further initiated the field of\\ncalculus of variations\\n,\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nand devised an early form of\\nregression analysis\\n.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nNewton was a fellow of\\nTrinity College\\nand the second\\nLucasian Professor of Mathematics\\nat the\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\n; he was appointed at the age of 26. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the\\nTrinity\\n. He refused to take\\nholy orders\\nin the\\nChurch of England\\n, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the\\nmathematical sciences\\n, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of\\nalchemy\\nand\\nbiblical chronology\\n, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the\\nWhig party\\n, Newton served two brief terms as\\nMember of Parliament for the University of Cambridge\\n, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. He was\\nknighted\\nby\\nQueen Anne\\nin 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as\\nWarden\\n(1696–1699) and\\nMaster\\n(1699–1727) of the\\nRoyal Mint\\n, in which he increased the accuracy and security of British coinage,\\n[\\n26\\n]\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nas well as president of the\\nRoyal Society\\n(1703–1727).\\nEarly life\\nMain article:\\nEarly life of Isaac Newton\\nIsaac Newton was born (according to the\\nJulian calendar\\nin use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (\\nNS\\n4 January 1643\\n[\\na\\n]\\n) at\\nWoolsthorpe Manor\\nin\\nWoolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth\\n, a\\nhamlet\\nin the county of Lincolnshire.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.\\nBorn prematurely\\n, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a\\nquart\\nmug.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nWhen Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\"\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nNewton\\'s mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nThe King\\'s School\\nFrom the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at\\nThe King\\'s School\\nin\\nGrantham\\n, which taught\\nLatin\\nand\\nAncient Greek\\nand probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nHe was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nHenry Stokes, master at The King\\'s School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,\\n[\\n34\\n]\\ndistinguishing himself mainly by building\\nsundials\\nand models of windmills.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\nIn June 1661, Newton was admitted to\\nTrinity College\\nat the\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\n. His uncle the Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a\\nsubsizar\\n, paying his way by performing\\nvalet\\nduties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his\\nMA\\n.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAt the time, Cambridge\\'s teachings were based on those of\\nAristotle\\n, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including\\nDescartes\\nand\\nastronomers\\nsuch as\\nGalileo Galilei\\nand\\nThomas Street\\n. He set down in his notebook a series of \"\\nQuaestiones\\n\" about\\nmechanical philosophy\\nas he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised\\nbinomial theorem\\nand began to develop a mathematical theory that later became\\ncalculus\\n. Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the\\nGreat Plague\\n.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nAlthough he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, his private studies and the years following his bachelor\\'s degree have been described as \"the richest and most productive ever experienced by a scientist\".\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nThe next two years alone saw the development of theories on calculus,\\n[\\n39\\n]\\noptics\\n, and the\\nlaw of gravitation\\n, at his home in Woolsthorpe. The physicist Louis T. More stated that \"There are no other examples of achievement in the history of science to compare with that of Newton during those two golden years.\"\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nNewton has been described as an \"exceptionally organized\" person when it came to note-taking, further dog-earing pages he saw as important. Furthermore, Newton\\'s \"indexes look like present-day indexes: They are alphabetical, by topic.\" His books showed his interests to be wide-ranging, with Newton himself described as a \"Janusian thinker, someone who could mix and combine seemingly disparate fields to stimulate creative breakthroughs.\"\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nIn April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nFellows were required to take\\nholy orders\\nand be ordained as\\nAnglican\\npriests, although this was not enforced in the\\nRestoration\\nyears, and an assertion of conformity to the\\nChurch of England\\nwas sufficient. He made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7\\xa0years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.\"\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nUp until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the\\nThirty-nine Articles\\n, the basis of Church of England doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nHis academic work impressed the\\nLucasian Professor\\nIsaac Barrow\\n, who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King\\nCharles II\\n, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a conflict between Newton\\'s religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nHe was appointed at the age of 26.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nSome of the figures added by Isaac Newton in his 1672 and 1681 editions of the\\nGeographia Generalis\\n. These figures appeared in subsequent editions as well.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nThe Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge position included the responsibility of instructing\\ngeography\\n.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nIn 1672, and again in 1681, Newton published a revised, corrected, and amended edition of the\\nGeographia Generalis\\n, a geography textbook first published in 1650 by the then-deceased\\nBernhardus Varenius\\n.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nIn the\\nGeographia Generalis,\\nVarenius attempted to create a theoretical foundation linking scientific principles to classical concepts in geography, and considered geography to be a mix between science and pure mathematics applied to quantifying features of the Earth.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nWhile it is unclear if Newton ever lectured in geography, the 1733 Dugdale and Shaw English translation of the book stated Newton published the book to be read by students while he lectured on the subject.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nThe\\nGeographia Generalis\\nis viewed by some as the dividing line between ancient and modern traditions in the\\nhistory of geography\\n, and Newton\\'s involvement in the subsequent editions is thought to be a large part of the reason for this enduring legacy.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nNewton was elected a\\nFellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nMid-life\\nCalculus\\nNewton\\'s work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\".\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nHis work on calculus, usually referred to as fluxions, began in 1664, and by May 20, 1665 as seen in a manuscript, Newton \"had already developed the calculus to the point where he could compute the tangent and the curvature at any point of a continuous curve\".\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nAnother manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton\\'s mathematical papers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nHis work\\nDe analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas\\n, sent by\\nIsaac Barrow\\nto\\nJohn Collins\\nin June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nNewton later\\nbecame involved in a dispute\\nwith\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nover priority in the development of calculus. Both are now credited with independently developing calculus, though with very different\\nmathematical notations\\n. However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nLeibniz\\'s notation is recognized as the more convenient notation, being adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820, by British mathematicians.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nHistorian of science\\nA. Rupert Hall\\nnotes that while Leibniz deserves credit for his independent formulation of calculus, Newton was undoubtedly the first to develop it, stating:\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBut all these matters are of little weight in comparison with the central truth, which has indeed long been universally recognized, that Newton was master of the essential techniques of the calculus by the end of 1666, almost exactly nine years before Leibniz . . . Newton’s claim to have mastered the new infinitesimal calculus long before Leibniz, and even to have written — or at least made a good start upon — a publishable exposition of it as early as 1671, is certainly borne out by copious evidence, and though Leibniz and some of his friends sought to belittle Newton’s case, the truth has not been seriously in doubt for the last 250 years.\\nHall further notes that in\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton was able to \"formulate and resolve problems by the integration of differential equations\" and \"in fact, he anticipated in his book many results that later exponents of the calculus regarded as their own novel achievements.\"\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nIt has been noted that despite the convenience of Leibniz\\'s notation, Newton\\'s notation could still have been used to develop multivariate techniques, with his dot notation still widely used in\\nphysics\\n. Some academics have noted the richness and depth of Newton\\'s work, such as physicist\\nRoger Penrose\\n, stating \"in most cases Newton’s geometrical methods are not only more concise and elegant, they reveal deeper principles than would become evident by the use of those formal methods of calculus that nowadays would seem more direct.\" Mathematician\\nVladimir Arnold\\nstates \"Comparing the texts of Newton with the comments of his successors, it is striking how Newton’s original presentation is more modern, more understandable and richer in ideas than the translation due to commentators of his geometrical ideas into the formal language of the calculus of Leibniz.\"\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nHis work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the\\nPrincipia\\nitself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\"\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nand explained why he put his expositions in this form,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nremarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nBecause of this, the\\nPrincipia\\nhas been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nand in Newton\\'s time \"nearly all of it is of this calculus.\"\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nHis use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in his\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum\\nof 1684\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nand in his papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nNewton in 1702 by\\nGodfrey Kneller\\nNewton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nHe was close to the Swiss mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton\\'s\\nPrincipia\\n, and corresponded with Leibniz.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nIn 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nStarting in 1699, Duillier accused Leibniz of plagiarism.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nMathematician\\nJohn Keill\\naccused Leibniz of plagiarism in 1708 in the Royal Society journal, thereby deteriorating the situation even more.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nThe dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study\\'s concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both men until Leibniz\\'s death in 1716.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nNewton is credited with the\\ngeneralised binomial theorem\\n, valid for any exponent. He discovered\\nNewton\\'s identities\\n,\\nNewton\\'s method\\n, classified\\ncubic plane curves\\n(\\npolynomials\\nof degree three in two\\nvariables\\n), made substantial contributions to the theory of\\nfinite differences\\n, with Newton regarded as \"the single most significant contributor to finite difference\\ninterpolation\\n\", with many formulas created by Newton.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nHe was the first to state\\nBézout\\'s theorem\\n, and was also the first to use fractional indices and to employ\\ncoordinate geometry\\nto derive solutions to\\nDiophantine equations\\n. He approximated\\npartial\\nsums of the\\nharmonic series\\nby\\nlogarithms\\n(a precursor to\\nEuler\\'s summation formula\\n) and was the first to use\\npower series\\nwith confidence and to revert power series. He originated the\\nNewton-Cotes formulas\\nfor\\nnumerical integration\\n. His work on infinite series was inspired by\\nSimon Stevin\\n\\'s decimals.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nHe also initiated the field of\\ncalculus of variations\\n, being the first to clearly formulate and correctly solve a problem in the field, that being\\nNewton\\'s minimal resistance problem\\n, which he posed and solved in 1685, and then later published in\\nPrincipia\\nin 1687.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nIt is regarded as one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century.\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nHe then used calculus of variations in his solving of the\\nbrachistochrone curve\\nproblem in 1697, which was posed by\\nJohann Bernoulli\\nin 1696, thus he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nOptics\\nA replica of the reflecting telescope Newton presented to the\\nRoyal Society\\nin 1672 (the first one he made in 1668 was loaned to an instrument maker but there is no further record of what happened to it).\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a\\nprism\\nin the position of\\nminimum deviation\\nis oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.\\n[\\n79\\n]\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nThis led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.\\nFrom 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nDuring this period he investigated the\\nrefraction\\nof light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a\\nspectrum\\n, could be recomposed into white light by a\\nlens\\nand a second prism.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nModern scholarship has revealed that Newton\\'s analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to\\ncorpuscular\\nalchemy.\\n[\\n83\\n]\\nIn his work on\\nNewton\\'s rings\\nin 1671, he used a method that was unprecedented in the 17th century, as \"he\\naveraged\\nall of the differences, and he then calculated the difference between the average and the value for the first ring\", in effect introducing a now\\nstandard method\\nfor reducing noise in measurements, and which does not appear elsewhere at the time.\\n[\\n84\\n]\\nHe extended his \"error-slaying method\" to studies of equinoxes in 1700, which was described as an \"altogether unprecedented method\" but differed in that here \"Newton required good values for each of the original equinoctial times, and so he devised a method that allowed them to, as it were, self-correct.\"\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nNewton is credited with introducing \"an embryonic linear\\nregression analysis\\n\", as he averaged a set of data, 50 years before\\nTobias Mayer\\n, and also \"summing the residuals to zero he\\nforced\\nthe regression line to pass through the average point\". He also \"distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an\\noptimal\\nsolution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness\".\\n[\\n85\\n]\\nHe showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as\\nNewton\\'s theory of colour\\n.\\n[\\n86\\n]\\nIllustration of a\\ndispersive prism\\nseparating white light into the colours of the spectrum, as discovered by Newton\\nFrom this work, he concluded that the lens of any\\nrefracting telescope\\nwould suffer from the\\ndispersion\\nof light into colours (\\nchromatic aberration\\n). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the\\nobjective\\nto bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a\\nNewtonian telescope\\n, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique.\\n[\\n87\\n]\\nHe grounded his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective\\nspeculum metal\\n, using Newton\\'s rings to judge the\\nquality\\nof the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,\\n[\\n88\\n]\\nhe was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, he was asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope by the Royal Society.\\n[\\n89\\n]\\nTheir interest encouraged him to publish his notes,\\nOf Colours\\n,\\n[\\n90\\n]\\nwhich he later expanded into the work\\nOpticks\\n. When\\nRobert Hooke\\ncriticised some of Newton\\'s ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. However, the two had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society,\\n[\\n91\\n]\\nopened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,\\n[\\n92\\n]\\nwhich had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. The two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke\\'s death.\\n[\\n93\\n]\\nFacsimile of a 1682 letter from Newton to\\nWilliam Briggs\\n, commenting on Briggs\\'\\nA New Theory of Vision\\nNewton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (\\nOpticks\\nBk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of \\'fits\\' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). Physicists later favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the\\ninterference\\npatterns and the general phenomenon of\\ndiffraction\\n. Despite his known preference of a particle theory, Newton in fact noted that light had both particle-like and wave-like properties in\\nOpticks\\n, and was the first to attempt to reconcile the two theories, thereby anticipating later developments of\\nwave-particle duality\\n, which is the modern understanding of light.\\n[\\n94\\n]\\nIn his\\nHypothesis of Light\\nof 1675, Newton posited the existence of the\\nether\\nto transmit forces between particles. The contact with the\\nCambridge Platonist\\nphilosopher\\nHenry More\\nrevived his interest in alchemy.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nHe replaced the ether with occult forces based on\\nHermetic\\nideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. His contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nThis was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.\\n[\\n96\\n]\\n[\\n97\\n]\\nIn 1704, Newton published\\nOpticks\\n, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light, and included a set of queries at the end, which were posed as unanswered questions and positive assertions. In line with his corpuscle theory, he thought that normal matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation, with query 30 stating \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"\\n[\\n98\\n]\\nQuery 6 introduced the concept of a\\nblack body\\n.\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nNewton investigated\\nelectricity\\nby constructing a primitive form of a frictional\\nelectrostatic generator\\nusing a glass globe,\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nand detailed an experiment in 1675 that showed when one side of a glass sheet is rubbed to create an electric charge, it attracts \"light bodies\" to the opposite side. He interpreted this as evidence that electric forces could pass through glass.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHis idea in\\nOpticks\\nthat optical reflection and refraction arise from interactions across the entire surface is regarded as the beginning of the field theory of electric force.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nHis mass-dispersion model, ancestral to the successful use of the\\nleast action principle\\n, provided a credible framework for understanding refraction, particularly in its approach to refraction in terms of momentum.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn\\nOpticks\\n, he was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton\\'s discussion,\\nmultiple-prism beam expanders\\nbecame central to the development of\\nnarrow-linewidth\\ntunable lasers\\n. The use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the\\nmultiple-prism dispersion theory\\n.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nSubsequent to Newton, much has been amended.\\nThomas Young\\nand\\nAugustin-Jean Fresnel\\ndiscarded Newton\\'s particle theory in favour of\\nChristiaan Huygens\\n\\' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light\\'s wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist,\\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\\n, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton\\'s armour,\\xa0... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by\\nDollond\\nto be wrong.\"\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nEngraving of\\nPortrait of Newton\\nby\\nJohn Vanderbank\\nGravity\\nNewton\\'s own copy of\\nPrincipia\\nwith Newton\\'s hand-written corrections for the second edition, now housed in the\\nWren Library\\nat\\nTrinity College, Cambridge\\nNewton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665.\\n[\\n105\\n]\\nIn 1679, he returned to his work on\\ncelestial mechanics\\nby considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of\\nplanets\\nwith reference to\\nKepler\\'s laws\\nof planetary motion. Newton\\'s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with\\nJohn Flamsteed\\n.\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nAfter the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. He communicated his results to\\nEdmond Halley\\nand to the Royal Society in\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum\\n, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society\\'s Register Book in December 1684.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\nThis tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the\\nPrincipia\\n.\\nThe\\nPrincipia\\nwas published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton stated the\\nthree universal laws of motion\\n. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for\\nclassical mechanics\\n. They contributed to many advances during the\\nIndustrial Revolution\\nwhich soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word\\ngravitas\\n(weight) for the effect that would become known as\\ngravity\\n, and defined the law of\\nuniversal gravitation\\n.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nHis work achieved the\\nfirst great unification in physics\\n.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nHe further solved the\\ntwo-body problem\\n, and introduced the\\nthree-body problem\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIn the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using \\'first and last ratios\\', gave the first analytical determination (based on\\nBoyle\\'s law\\n) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth\\'s spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon\\'s gravitational attraction on the Earth\\'s oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the\\nirregularities in the motion of the Moon\\n, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nNewton\\'s biographer\\nDavid Brewster\\nreported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton\\'s health: \"[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep\" during his work on the problem in 1692–93, and told the astronomer\\nJohn Machin\\nthat \"his head never ached but when he was studying the subject\". According to Brewster, Halley also told\\nJohn Conduitt\\nthat when pressed to complete his analysis Newton \"always replied that it made his head ache, and\\nkept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more\\n\". [Emphasis in original]\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nNewton made clear his\\nheliocentric\\nview of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nFor Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem\\'d the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\". (Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.)\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nNewton was criticised for introducing \"\\noccult\\nagencies\" into science because of his postulate of an invisible\\nforce able to act over vast distances\\n.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nLater, in the second edition of the\\nPrincipia\\n(1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding\\nGeneral Scholium\\n, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here he used what became his famous expression\\n\"\\nHypotheses non fingo\\n\"\\n.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\n)\\nWith the\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton became internationally recognised.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nHe acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nIn the 1660s and 1670s, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types, systemizing his results in later publications. However, a 1690s manuscript later analyzed showed that Newton had identified all 78 cubic curves, but chose not to publish the remaining six for unknown reasons.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIn 1717, and probably with Newton\\'s help,\\nJames Stirling\\nproved that every cubic was one of these four types. He claimed that the four types could be obtained by\\nplane projection\\nfrom one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nOther significant work\\nNewton studied heat and energy flow, formulating an\\nempirical law of cooling\\nwhich states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surrounding environment. It was first formulated in 1701, and is the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of\\nconvective heat transfer\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nNewton introduced the notion of a\\nNewtonian fluid\\nwith his formulation of his\\nlaw of viscosity\\nin\\nPrincipia\\nin 1687. It states that the shear stress between two fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradient between them.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPhilosophy of Science\\nStarting with the second edition of his\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method. It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, \"hypotheses non fingo\", which can be translated as \"I don\\'t make hypotheses,\" (the direct translation of \"fingo\" is \"frame\", but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science). He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation. The quote in part as translated is, \"Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nNewton contributed to and refined the\\nscientific method\\n. In his work on the properties of light in the 1670s, he showed his rigorous method, which was conducting experiments, taking detailed notes, making measurements, conducting more experiments that grew out of the initial ones, he formulated a theory, created more experiments to test it, and finally described the entire process so other scientists could replicate every step.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nIn his 1687\\nPrincipia\\n, he outlined four rules: the first is, \\'Admit no more causes of natural things than are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances\\'; the second is, \\'To the same natural effect, assign the same causes\\'; the third is, \\'Qualities of bodies, which are found to belong to all bodies within experiments, are to be esteemed universal\\'; and lastly, \\'Propositions collected from observation of phenomena should be viewed as accurate or very nearly true until contradicted by other phenomena\\'. These rules have become the basis of the modern approaches to science.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nLater life\\nFurther information:\\nLater life of Isaac Newton\\nRoyal Mint\\nIsaac Newton in old age in 1712, portrait by\\nSir James Thornhill\\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of\\nreligious tracts\\ndealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to\\nJohn Locke\\nin which he disputed the fidelity of\\n1 John 5:7\\n—the\\nJohannine Comma\\n—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nNewton was also a member of the\\nParliament of England\\nfor\\nCambridge University\\nin 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nHe was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist\\nAbraham de la Pryme\\nto have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nNewton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the\\nRoyal Mint\\nduring the reign of\\nKing William III\\nin 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of\\nCharles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax\\n, then\\nChancellor of the Exchequer\\n. He took charge of England\\'s great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy\\ncomptroller\\nof the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known\\nMaster of the Mint\\nupon the death of\\nThomas Neale\\nin 1699, a position he held for the last 30\\xa0years of his life.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nThese appointments were intended as\\nsinecures\\n, but Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish\\nclippers\\nand counterfeiters.\\nAs Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20\\xa0percent of the coins taken in during the\\nGreat Recoinage of 1696\\nwere\\ncounterfeit\\n. Counterfeiting was\\nhigh treason\\n, punishable by the felon being\\nhanged, drawn and quartered\\n. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nDisguised as a\\nhabitué\\nof bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself.\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nFor all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government,\\nEnglish law\\nstill had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a\\njustice of the peace\\nin all the\\nhome counties\\n. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton\\'s personal first edition of\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\n, which he must have been amending at the time.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nThen he conducted more than 100\\xa0cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He successfully prosecuted 28\\xa0coiners, including serial counterfeiter\\nWilliam Chaloner\\n, who was subsequently hanged.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\nBeyond prosecuting counterfeiters, he improved minting technology and reduced the standard deviation of the weight of guineas from 1.3 grams to 0.75 grams. Starting in 1707, Newton introduced the practice of testing a small sample of coins, a pound in weight, in the\\ntrial of the pyx\\n, which helped to reduce the size of admissible error. He ultimately saved the Treasury a then £41,510, roughly £3 million in 2012,\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nwith his improvements lasting until the 1770s, thereby increasing the accuracy of British coinage.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nCoat of arms\\nof the Newton family of\\nGreat Gonerby\\n, Lincolnshire, afterwards used by Sir Isaac\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nNewton was made president of the\\nRoyal Society\\nin 1703 and an associate of the French\\nAcadémie des Sciences\\n. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of\\nJohn Flamsteed\\n, the\\nAstronomer Royal\\n, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed\\'s\\nHistoria Coelestis Britannica\\n, which Newton had used in his studies.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nKnighthood\\nIn April 1705, Queen Anne\\nknighted\\nNewton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the\\nparliamentary election in May 1705\\n, rather than any recognition of Newton\\'s scientific work or services as Master of the Mint.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\nNewton was the second scientist to be knighted, after\\nFrancis Bacon\\n.\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nAs a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty\\'s Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21\\xa0silver shillings.\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nThis inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the\\nsilver standard\\nto its first\\ngold standard\\n. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\nIt has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nNewton was invested in the\\nSouth Sea Company\\nand lost some £20,000 (£4.4\\xa0million in 2020\\n[\\n136\\n]\\n) when it collapsed in around 1720.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nToward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at\\nCranbury Park\\n, near\\nWinchester\\n, with his niece and her husband, until his death.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nHis half-niece,\\nCatherine Barton\\n,\\n[\\n139\\n]\\nserved as his hostess in social affairs at his house on\\nJermyn Street\\nin London; he was her \"very loving Uncle\",\\n[\\n140\\n]\\naccording to his letter to her when she was recovering from\\nsmallpox\\n.\\nDeath\\nDeath mask of Newton, photographed\\nc.\\n1906\\nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (\\nOS\\n20 March 1726;\\nNS\\n31 March 1727).\\n[\\na\\n]\\nHe was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in\\nWestminster Abbey\\namong kings and queens. He was the first scientist to be buried in the abbey.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\nVoltaire\\nmay have been present at his funeral.\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nA bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died\\nintestate\\n.\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nHis papers went to\\nJohn Conduitt\\nand\\nCatherine Barton\\n.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nShortly after his death, a plaster\\ndeath mask\\nwas moulded of Newton.

The French writer and philosopher\\nVoltaire\\n, who was in London at the time of Newton\\'s funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.”\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nThere exists a widespread belief that Newton died a\\nvirgin\\n, and writers as diverse as mathematician\\nCharles Hutton\\n,\\n[\\n150\\n]\\neconomist\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n,\\n[\\n151\\n]\\nand physicist\\nCarl Sagan\\nhave commented on it.\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nNewton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n, whom he met in London around 1689;\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nsome of their correspondence has survived.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nTheir relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a\\nnervous breakdown\\n,\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nwhich included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends\\nSamuel Pepys\\nand\\nJohn Locke\\n. His note to the latter included the charge that Locke had endeavoured to \"embroil\" him with \"woemen & by other means\".\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nNewton appeared to be relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a later memoir, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nNonetheless, he could be fiercely competitive and did on occasion hold grudges against his intellectual rivals, not abstaining from personal attacks when it suited him—a common trait found in many of his contemporaries.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nIn a letter to\\nRobert Hooke\\nin February 1676, for instance, he confessed \"If I have seen further it is by\\nstanding on the shoulders of giants\\n.\"\\n[\\n159\\n]\\nSome historians argued that this, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were disputing over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke who was presumably short and hunchbacked, rather than (or in addition to) a statement of modesty.\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nOn the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, found in 17th century poet\\nGeorge Herbert\\n\\'s\\nJacula Prudentum\\n(1651) among others, had as its main point that \"a dwarf on a giant\\'s shoulders sees farther of the two\", and so in effect place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the \\'dwarf\\' who saw farther.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nTheology\\nReligious views\\nMain articles:\\nReligious views of Isaac Newton\\nand\\nIsaac Newton\\'s occult studies\\nAlthough born into an\\nAnglican\\nfamily, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity,\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nwith historian\\nStephen Snobelen\\nlabelling him a\\nheretic\\n.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nBy 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972.\\n[\\n164\\n]\\nOver half of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and most has never been printed.\\n[\\n164\\n]\\nHis writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of\\nearly Church\\nwritings and show that in the conflict between\\nAthanasius\\nand\\nArius\\nwhich defined the\\nCreed\\n, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the\\nTrinity\\n. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.\"\\n[\\n165\\n]\\nHe was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, \"the\\ngreat apostasy\\nwas trinitarianism.\"\\n[\\n166\\n]\\nNewton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.\\n[\\n167\\n]\\nWorshipping\\nJesus Christ\\nas\\nGod\\nwas, in Newton\\'s eyes,\\nidolatry\\n, an act he believed to be the fundamental\\nsin\\n.\\n[\\n168\\n]\\nIn 1999, Snobelen wrote, that\"Isaac Newton was a\\nheretic\\n. But\\xa0... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs.\" Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a\\nSocinian\\nsympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an\\nArian\\nand almost certainly an\\nanti-trinitarian\\n.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nNewton\\n(1795, detail) by\\nWilliam Blake\\n. Newton is depicted critically as a \"divine geometer\".\\n[\\n169\\n]\\nAlthough the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\\'s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, \"So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun\".\\n[\\n170\\n]\\nAlong with his scientific fame, Newton\\'s studies of the Bible and of the early\\nChurch Fathers\\nwere also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on\\ntextual criticism\\n, most notably\\nAn Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture\\nand\\nObservations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John\\n.\\n[\\n171\\n]\\nHe placed the crucifixion of\\nJesus Christ\\nat 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.\\n[\\n172\\n]\\nHe believed in a rationally\\nimmanent\\nworld, but he rejected the\\nhylozoism\\nimplicit in\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nand\\nBaruch Spinoza\\n. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, he claimed that in writing the\\nPrincipia\\n\"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\".\\n[\\n173\\n]\\nHe saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.\\n[\\n174\\n]\\nFor this, Leibniz lampooned him: \"God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"\\n[\\n175\\n]\\nNewton\\'s position was defended by his follower\\nSamuel Clarke\\nin a\\nfamous correspondence\\n. A century later,\\nPierre-Simon Laplace\\n\\'s work\\nCelestial Mechanics\\nhad a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.\\n[\\n176\\n]\\nThe contrast between Laplace\\'s mechanistic worldview and Newton\\'s one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave\\nNapoleon\\n, who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the\\nMécanique céleste\\n: \"Sire, j\\'ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse\" (\"Sir, I didn\\'t need this hypothesis\").\\n[\\n177\\n]\\nScholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the\\nTrinity\\n. His first biographer,\\nDavid Brewster\\n, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.\\n[\\n178\\n]\\nIn the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n(among others) were deciphered\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nand it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nReligious thought\\nNewton and\\nRobert Boyle\\n\\'s approach to the\\nmechanical philosophy\\nwas promoted by\\nrationalist\\npamphleteers as a viable alternative to the\\npantheists\\nand\\nenthusiasts\\n, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the\\nlatitudinarians\\n.\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nThe clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and\\nmetaphysical\\nsuperlatives of both\\nsuperstitious\\nenthusiasm and the threat of\\natheism\\n,\\n[\\n181\\n]\\nand at the same time, the second wave of English\\ndeists\\nused Newton\\'s discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\".\\nThe attacks made against pre-\\nEnlightenment\\n\"\\nmagical thinking\\n\", and the\\nmystical elements of Christianity\\n, were given their foundation with Boyle\\'s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle\\'s ideas their completion through\\nmathematical proofs\\nand, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nAlchemy\\nNewton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child born with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage.\\n–\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n, \"Newton, the Man\"\\n[\\n183\\n]\\nOf an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton\\'s papers, about one million deal with\\nalchemy\\n.

Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton\\'s involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, \"chymistry.\"\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nIn June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton\\'s notes on\\nJan Baptist van Helmont\\n\\'s book on plague,\\nDe Peste\\n,\\n[\\n189\\n]\\nwere being auctioned online by\\nBonhams\\n. Newton\\'s analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London\\'s 1665–1666\\ninfection\\n, is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that \"the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison\".\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nLegacy\\nSee also:\\nIsaac Newton in popular culture\\nRecognition\\nNewton\\'s tomb monument in\\nWestminster Abbey\\nby\\nJohn Michael Rysbrack\\nThe mathematician and astronomer\\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange\\nfrequently asserted that Newton was the greatest\\ngenius\\nwho ever lived,\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nand once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\"\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nEnglish poet\\nAlexander Pope\\nwrote the famous\\nepitaph\\n:\\nNature, and Nature\\'s laws lay hid in night.\\nGod said,\\nLet Newton be!\\nand all was light.\\nBut this was not allowed to be inscribed in Newton\\'s monument at Westminster.

Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners.

He was born on 25th December 1642, and died on 20th March 1726.\\nNewton has been called \"the most influential figure in the history of Western science\",\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nand has been regarded as \"the central figure in the history of science\", who \"more than anyone else is the source of our great confidence in the power of science.\"\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nNew Scientist\\ncalled Newton \"the supreme genius and most enigmatic character in the history of science\".\\n[\\n196\\n]\\nThe philosopher and historian\\nDavid Hume\\nalso declared that Newton was \"the greatest and rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the species\".\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nIn his home of\\nMonticello\\n,\\nThomas Jefferson\\n, a\\nFounding Father\\nand\\nPresident of the United States\\n, kept portraits of\\nJohn Locke\\n,\\nSir Francis Bacon\\n, and Newton, whom he described as \"the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception\", and who he credited with laying \"the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical and Moral sciences\".\\n[\\n198\\n]\\nNewton has further been called \"the towering figure of the\\nScientific Revolution\\n\" and that \"In a period rich with outstanding thinkers, Newton was simply the most outstanding.\" The polymath\\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\\nlabeled Newton\\'s birth as the \"\\nChristmas\\nof the modern age\".\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nIn the Italian polymath\\nVilfredo Pareto\\n\\'s estimation, Newton was the greatest human being who ever lived.\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nOn the bicentennial of Newton\\'s death in 1927, astronomer\\nJames Jeans\\nstated that he \"was certainly the greatest man of science, and perhaps the greatest intellect, the human race has seen\".\\n[\\n200\\n]\\nNewton ultimately conceived four revolutions—in optics, mathematics, mechanics, and gravity—but also foresaw a fifth in electricity, though he lacked the time and energy in old age to fully accomplish it.\\n[\\n201\\n]\\n[\\n202\\n]\\nThe physicist\\nLudwig Boltzmann\\ncalled Newton\\'s\\nPrincipia\\n\"the first and greatest work ever written about\\ntheoretical physics\\n\".\\n[\\n203\\n]\\nPhysicist\\nStephen Hawking\\nsimilarly called\\nPrincipia\\n\"probably the most important single work ever published in the\\nphysical sciences\\n\".\\n[\\n204\\n]\\nLagrange called\\nPrincipia\\n\"the greatest production of the human mind\", and noted that \"he felt dazed at such an illustration of what man\\'s intellect might be capable\".\\n[\\n205\\n]\\nPhysicist\\nEdward Andrade\\nstated that Newton \"was capable of greater sustained mental effort than any man, before or since\", and noted earlier the place of Isaac Newton in history, stating:\\n[\\n206\\n]\\nFrom time to time in the history of mankind a man arises who is of universal significance, whose work changes the current of human thought or of human experience, so that all that comes after him bears evidence of his spirit. Such a man was\\nShakespeare\\n, such a man was\\nBeethoven\\n, such a man was Newton, and, of the three, his kingdom is the most widespread.\\nThe French physicist and mathematician\\nJean-Baptiste Biot\\npraised Newton\\'s genius, stating that:\\n[\\n207\\n]\\nNever was the supremacy of intellect so justly established and so fully confessed . . . In mathematical and in experimental science without an equal and without an example; combining the genius for both in its highest degree.\\nDespite his rivalry with\\nGottfried Wilhem Leibniz\\n, Leibniz still praised the work of Newton, with him responding to a question at a dinner in 1701 from\\nSophia Charlotte\\n, the Queen of Prussia, about his view of Newton with:\\n[\\n208\\n]\\n[\\n209\\n]\\nTaking mathematics from the beginning of the world to the time of when Newton lived, what he had done was much the better half.\\nMathematician\\nE.T.

Stukeley recorded in his\\nMemoirs of Sir Isaac Newton\\'s Life\\na conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:\\n[\\n232\\n]\\n[\\n233\\n]\\nwe went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. \"why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,\" thought he to him self: occasion\\'d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: \"why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.\"\\nJohn Conduitt\\n, Newton\\'s assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton\\'s niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton\\'s life:\\n[\\n234\\n]\\nIn the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.\\nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory.\\n[\\n235\\n]\\nThe question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon\\'s orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\".\\nVarious trees are claimed to be \"the\" apple tree which Newton describes. The\\nKing\\'s School, Grantham\\nclaims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster\\'s garden some years later. The staff of the (now)\\nNational Trust\\n-owned\\nWoolsthorpe Manor\\ndispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree\\n[\\n236\\n]\\ncan be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The\\nNational Fruit Collection\\nat\\nBrogdale\\nin Kent\\n[\\n237\\n]\\ncan supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to\\nFlower of Kent\\n, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.\\n[\\n238\\n]\\nCommemorations\\nNewton statue on display at the\\nOxford University Museum of Natural History\\nNewton\\'s monument (1731) can be seen in\\nWestminster Abbey\\n, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor\\nMichael Rysbrack\\n(1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect\\nWilliam Kent\\n.\\n[\\n239\\n]\\nThe monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts\\nputti\\nusing instruments such as a telescope and prism.\\n[\\n240\\n]\\nFrom 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1\\nbanknotes\\nissued by the\\nBank of England\\n(the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England).

He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation. The quote in part as translated is, \"Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.

      "In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.\n",

He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\".\n",

a\\nmathematician\\n,\\nphysicist\\n,\\nastronomer\\n,\\nalchemist\\n,\\ntheologian\\n, and author.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nNewton was a key figure in the\\nScientific Revolution\\nand the\\nEnlightenment\\nthat followed.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nHis book\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\n(\\nMathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\n), first published in 1687, achieved the\\nfirst great unification in physics\\nand established\\nclassical mechanics\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nNewton also made seminal contributions to\\noptics\\n, and\\nshares credit\\nwith German mathematician\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nfor formulating\\ninfinitesimal calculus\\n, though he developed calculus years before Leibniz.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nHe contributed to and refined the\\nscientific method\\n, and his work is considered the most influential in bringing forth modern science.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\n[\\n12\\n]\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nIn the\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton formulated the\\nlaws of motion\\nand\\nuniversal gravitation\\nthat formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the\\ntheory of relativity\\n. He used his mathematical description of\\ngravity\\nto derive\\nKepler\\'s laws of planetary motion\\n, account for\\ntides\\n, the\\ntrajectories\\nof\\ncomets\\n, the\\nprecession of the equinoxes\\nand other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the\\nSolar System\\n\\'s\\nheliocentricity\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nNewton solved the\\ntwo-body problem\\n, and introduced the\\nthree-body problem\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nHe demonstrated that the\\nmotion of objects\\non Earth and\\ncelestial bodies\\ncould be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\\'s inference that the Earth is an\\noblate spheroid\\nwas later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of\\nMaupertuis\\n,\\nLa Condamine\\n, and others, thereby convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\\nNewton built the\\nfirst reflecting telescope\\nand developed a sophisticated\\ntheory of colour\\nbased on the observation that a\\nprism\\nseparates\\nwhite light\\ninto the colours of the\\nvisible spectrum\\n. His work on light was collected in his book\\nOpticks\\n, published in 1704. He originated prisms as\\nbeam expanders\\nand\\nmultiple-prism arrays\\n, which would later become integral to the development of\\ntunable lasers\\n.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nNewton also formulated an\\nempirical law of cooling\\n, which was the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of\\nconvective heat transfer\\n,\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nmade the first theoretical calculation of the\\nspeed of sound\\n, and introduced the notions of a\\nNewtonian fluid\\nand a\\nblack body\\n. Furthermore, he made early investigations into\\nelectricity\\n,\\n[\\n20\\n]\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nwith an idea from his book\\nOpticks\\narguably the beginning of the\\nfield theory of the electric force\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn addition to his creation of calculus, as a mathematician, he generalized the\\nbinomial theorem\\nto any real number, contributed to the study of\\npower series\\n, developed\\na method\\nfor approximating the\\nroots of a function\\n, classified most of the\\ncubic plane curves\\n, and also originated the\\nNewton-Cotes formulas\\nfor\\nnumerical integration\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nHe further initiated the field of\\ncalculus of variations\\n,\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nand devised an early form of\\nregression analysis\\n.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nNewton was a fellow of\\nTrinity College\\nand the second\\nLucasian Professor of Mathematics\\nat the\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\n; he was appointed at the age of 26. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the\\nTrinity\\n. He refused to take\\nholy orders\\nin the\\nChurch of England\\n, unlike most members of the Cambridge faculty of the day. Beyond his work on the\\nmathematical sciences\\n, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of\\nalchemy\\nand\\nbiblical chronology\\n, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the\\nWhig party\\n, Newton served two brief terms as\\nMember of Parliament for the University of Cambridge\\n, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. He was\\nknighted\\nby\\nQueen Anne\\nin 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as\\nWarden\\n(1696–1699) and\\nMaster\\n(1699–1727) of the\\nRoyal Mint\\n, in which he increased the accuracy and security of British coinage,\\n[\\n26\\n]\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nas well as president of the\\nRoyal Society\\n(1703–1727).\\nEarly life\\nMain article:\\nEarly life of Isaac Newton\\nIsaac Newton was born (according to the\\nJulian calendar\\nin use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (\\nNS\\n4 January 1643\\n[\\na\\n]\\n) at\\nWoolsthorpe Manor\\nin\\nWoolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth\\n, a\\nhamlet\\nin the county of Lincolnshire.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before.\\nBorn prematurely\\n, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a\\nquart\\nmug.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nWhen Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\"\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nNewton\\'s mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nThe King\\'s School\\nFrom the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at\\nThe King\\'s School\\nin\\nGrantham\\n, which taught\\nLatin\\nand\\nAncient Greek\\nand probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nHe was removed from school by his mother and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nHenry Stokes, master at The King\\'s School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student,\\n[\\n34\\n]\\ndistinguishing himself mainly by building\\nsundials\\nand models of windmills.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\nIn June 1661, Newton was admitted to\\nTrinity College\\nat the\\nUniversity of Cambridge\\n. His uncle the Reverend William Ayscough, who had studied at Cambridge, recommended him to the university. At Cambridge, Newton started as a\\nsubsizar\\n, paying his way by performing\\nvalet\\nduties until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, which covered his university costs for four more years until the completion of his\\nMA\\n.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAt the time, Cambridge\\'s teachings were based on those of\\nAristotle\\n, whom Newton read along with then more modern philosophers, including\\nDescartes\\nand\\nastronomers\\nsuch as\\nGalileo Galilei\\nand\\nThomas Street\\n. He set down in his notebook a series of \"\\nQuaestiones\\n\" about\\nmechanical philosophy\\nas he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised\\nbinomial theorem\\nand began to develop a mathematical theory that later became\\ncalculus\\n. Soon after Newton obtained his BA degree at Cambridge in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the\\nGreat Plague\\n.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nAlthough he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, his private studies and the years following his bachelor\\'s degree have been described as \"the richest and most productive ever experienced by a scientist\".\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nThe next two years alone saw the development of theories on calculus,\\n[\\n39\\n]\\noptics\\n, and the\\nlaw of gravitation\\n, at his home in Woolsthorpe. The physicist Louis T. More stated that \"There are no other examples of achievement in the history of science to compare with that of Newton during those two golden years.\"\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nNewton has been described as an \"exceptionally organized\" person when it came to note-taking, further dog-earing pages he saw as important. Furthermore, Newton\\'s \"indexes look like present-day indexes: They are alphabetical, by topic.\" His books showed his interests to be wide-ranging, with Newton himself described as a \"Janusian thinker, someone who could mix and combine seemingly disparate fields to stimulate creative breakthroughs.\"\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nIn April 1667, Newton returned to the University of Cambridge, and in October he was elected as a fellow of Trinity.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nFellows were required to take\\nholy orders\\nand be ordained as\\nAnglican\\npriests, although this was not enforced in the\\nRestoration\\nyears, and an assertion of conformity to the\\nChurch of England\\nwas sufficient. He made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7\\xa0years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.\"\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nUp until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the\\nThirty-nine Articles\\n, the basis of Church of England doctrine. By 1675 the issue could not be avoided, and by then his unconventional views stood in the way.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nHis academic work impressed the\\nLucasian Professor\\nIsaac Barrow\\n, who was anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity College two years later); in 1669, Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and King\\nCharles II\\n, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument; thus, a conflict between Newton\\'s religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nHe was appointed at the age of 26.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\nSome of the figures added by Isaac Newton in his 1672 and 1681 editions of the\\nGeographia Generalis\\n. These figures appeared in subsequent editions as well.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nThe Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge position included the responsibility of instructing\\ngeography\\n.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nIn 1672, and again in 1681, Newton published a revised, corrected, and amended edition of the\\nGeographia Generalis\\n, a geography textbook first published in 1650 by the then-deceased\\nBernhardus Varenius\\n.\\n[\\n49\\n]\\nIn the\\nGeographia Generalis,\\nVarenius attempted to create a theoretical foundation linking scientific principles to classical concepts in geography, and considered geography to be a mix between science and pure mathematics applied to quantifying features of the Earth.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\n[\\n50\\n]\\nWhile it is unclear if Newton ever lectured in geography, the 1733 Dugdale and Shaw English translation of the book stated Newton published the book to be read by students while he lectured on the subject.\\n[\\n48\\n]\\nThe\\nGeographia Generalis\\nis viewed by some as the dividing line between ancient and modern traditions in the\\nhistory of geography\\n, and Newton\\'s involvement in the subsequent editions is thought to be a large part of the reason for this enduring legacy.\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nNewton was elected a\\nFellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672\\n.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nMid-life\\nCalculus\\nNewton\\'s work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\".\\n[\\n52\\n]\\nHis work on calculus, usually referred to as fluxions, began in 1664, and by May 20, 1665 as seen in a manuscript, Newton \"had already developed the calculus to the point where he could compute the tangent and the curvature at any point of a continuous curve\".\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nAnother manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton\\'s mathematical papers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nHis work\\nDe analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas\\n, sent by\\nIsaac Barrow\\nto\\nJohn Collins\\nin June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nNewton later\\nbecame involved in a dispute\\nwith\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nover priority in the development of calculus. Both are now credited with independently developing calculus, though with very different\\nmathematical notations\\n. However, it is established that Newton came to develop calculus much earlier than Leibniz.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nLeibniz\\'s notation is recognized as the more convenient notation, being adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820, by British mathematicians.\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nHistorian of science\\nA. Rupert Hall\\nnotes that while Leibniz deserves credit for his independent formulation of calculus, Newton was undoubtedly the first to develop it, stating:\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBut all these matters are of little weight in comparison with the central truth, which has indeed long been universally recognized, that Newton was master of the essential techniques of the calculus by the end of 1666, almost exactly nine years before Leibniz . . . Newton’s claim to have mastered the new infinitesimal calculus long before Leibniz, and even to have written — or at least made a good start upon — a publishable exposition of it as early as 1671, is certainly borne out by copious evidence, and though Leibniz and some of his friends sought to belittle Newton’s case, the truth has not been seriously in doubt for the last 250 years.\\nHall further notes that in\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton was able to \"formulate and resolve problems by the integration of differential equations\" and \"in fact, he anticipated in his book many results that later exponents of the calculus regarded as their own novel achievements.\"\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nIt has been noted that despite the convenience of Leibniz\\'s notation, Newton\\'s notation could still have been used to develop multivariate techniques, with his dot notation still widely used in\\nphysics\\n. Some academics have noted the richness and depth of Newton\\'s work, such as physicist\\nRoger Penrose\\n, stating \"in most cases Newton’s geometrical methods are not only more concise and elegant, they reveal deeper principles than would become evident by the use of those formal methods of calculus that nowadays would seem more direct.\" Mathematician\\nVladimir Arnold\\nstates \"Comparing the texts of Newton with the comments of his successors, it is striking how Newton’s original presentation is more modern, more understandable and richer in ideas than the translation due to commentators of his geometrical ideas into the formal language of the calculus of Leibniz.\"\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nHis work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the\\nPrincipia\\nitself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\"\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nand explained why he put his expositions in this form,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\nremarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nBecause of this, the\\nPrincipia\\nhas been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nand in Newton\\'s time \"nearly all of it is of this calculus.\"\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nHis use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in his\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum\\nof 1684\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nand in his papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nNewton in 1702 by\\nGodfrey Kneller\\nNewton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nHe was close to the Swiss mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton\\'s\\nPrincipia\\n, and corresponded with Leibniz.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nIn 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nStarting in 1699, Duillier accused Leibniz of plagiarism.\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nMathematician\\nJohn Keill\\naccused Leibniz of plagiarism in 1708 in the Royal Society journal, thereby deteriorating the situation even more.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nThe dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study\\'s concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both men until Leibniz\\'s death in 1716.\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nNewton is credited with the\\ngeneralised binomial theorem\\n, valid for any exponent. He discovered\\nNewton\\'s identities\\n,\\nNewton\\'s method\\n, classified\\ncubic plane curves\\n(\\npolynomials\\nof degree three in two\\nvariables\\n), made substantial contributions to the theory of\\nfinite differences\\n, with Newton regarded as \"the single most significant contributor to finite difference\\ninterpolation\\n\", with many formulas created by Newton.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\nHe was the first to state\\nBézout\\'s theorem\\n, and was also the first to use fractional indices and to employ\\ncoordinate geometry\\nto derive solutions to\\nDiophantine equations\\n. He approximated\\npartial\\nsums of the\\nharmonic series\\nby\\nlogarithms\\n(a precursor to\\nEuler\\'s summation formula\\n) and was the first to use\\npower series\\nwith confidence and to revert power series. He originated the\\nNewton-Cotes formulas\\nfor\\nnumerical integration\\n. His work on infinite series was inspired by\\nSimon Stevin\\n\\'s decimals.\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nHe also initiated the field of\\ncalculus of variations\\n, being the first to clearly formulate and correctly solve a problem in the field, that being\\nNewton\\'s minimal resistance problem\\n, which he posed and solved in 1685, and then later published in\\nPrincipia\\nin 1687.\\n[\\n76\\n]\\nIt is regarded as one of the most difficult problems tackled by variational methods prior to the twentieth century.\\n[\\n77\\n]\\nHe then used calculus of variations in his solving of the\\nbrachistochrone curve\\nproblem in 1697, which was posed by\\nJohann Bernoulli\\nin 1696, thus he pioneered the field with his work on the two problems.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nOptics\\nA replica of the reflecting telescope Newton presented to the\\nRoyal Society\\nin 1672 (the first one he made in 1668 was loaned to an instrument maker but there is no further record of what happened to it).\\n[\\n78\\n]\\nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a\\nprism\\nin the position of\\nminimum deviation\\nis oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles.\\n[\\n79\\n]\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nThis led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.\\nFrom 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nDuring this period he investigated the\\nrefraction\\nof light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a\\nspectrum\\n, could be recomposed into white light by a\\nlens\\nand a second prism.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nModern scholarship has revealed that Newton\\'s analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to\\ncorpuscular\\nalchemy.\\n[\\n83\\n]\\nIn his work on\\nNewton\\'s rings\\nin 1671, he used a method that was unprecedented in the 17th century, as \"he\\naveraged\\nall of the differences, and he then calculated the difference between the average and the value for the first ring\", in effect introducing a now\\nstandard method\\nfor reducing noise in measurements, and which does not appear elsewhere at the time.\\n[\\n84\\n]\\nHe extended his \"error-slaying method\" to studies of equinoxes in 1700, which was described as an \"altogether unprecedented method\" but differed in that here \"Newton required good values for each of the original equinoctial times, and so he devised a method that allowed them to, as it were, self-correct.\"\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nNewton is credited with introducing \"an embryonic linear\\nregression analysis\\n\", as he averaged a set of data, 50 years before\\nTobias Mayer\\n, and also \"summing the residuals to zero he\\nforced\\nthe regression line to pass through the average point\". He also \"distinguished between two inhomogeneous sets of data and might have thought of an\\noptimal\\nsolution in terms of bias, though not in terms of effectiveness\".\\n[\\n85\\n]\\nHe showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as\\nNewton\\'s theory of colour\\n.\\n[\\n86\\n]\\nIllustration of a\\ndispersive prism\\nseparating white light into the colours of the spectrum, as discovered by Newton\\nFrom this work, he concluded that the lens of any\\nrefracting telescope\\nwould suffer from the\\ndispersion\\nof light into colours (\\nchromatic aberration\\n). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the\\nobjective\\nto bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a\\nNewtonian telescope\\n, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique.\\n[\\n87\\n]\\nHe grounded his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective\\nspeculum metal\\n, using Newton\\'s rings to judge the\\nquality\\nof the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668,\\n[\\n88\\n]\\nhe was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, he was asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope by the Royal Society.\\n[\\n89\\n]\\nTheir interest encouraged him to publish his notes,\\nOf Colours\\n,\\n[\\n90\\n]\\nwhich he later expanded into the work\\nOpticks\\n. When\\nRobert Hooke\\ncriticised some of Newton\\'s ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. However, the two had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, who had been appointed Secretary of the Royal Society,\\n[\\n91\\n]\\nopened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions,\\n[\\n92\\n]\\nwhich had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. The two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke\\'s death.\\n[\\n93\\n]\\nFacsimile of a 1682 letter from Newton to\\nWilliam Briggs\\n, commenting on Briggs\\'\\nA New Theory of Vision\\nNewton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (\\nOpticks\\nBk. II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of \\'fits\\' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). Physicists later favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the\\ninterference\\npatterns and the general phenomenon of\\ndiffraction\\n. Despite his known preference of a particle theory, Newton in fact noted that light had both particle-like and wave-like properties in\\nOpticks\\n, and was the first to attempt to reconcile the two theories, thereby anticipating later developments of\\nwave-particle duality\\n, which is the modern understanding of light.\\n[\\n94\\n]\\nIn his\\nHypothesis of Light\\nof 1675, Newton posited the existence of the\\nether\\nto transmit forces between particles. The contact with the\\nCambridge Platonist\\nphilosopher\\nHenry More\\nrevived his interest in alchemy.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nHe replaced the ether with occult forces based on\\nHermetic\\nideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. His contributions to science cannot be isolated from his interest in alchemy.\\n[\\n95\\n]\\nThis was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.\\n[\\n96\\n]\\n[\\n97\\n]\\nIn 1704, Newton published\\nOpticks\\n, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light, and included a set of queries at the end, which were posed as unanswered questions and positive assertions. In line with his corpuscle theory, he thought that normal matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation, with query 30 stating \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\"\\n[\\n98\\n]\\nQuery 6 introduced the concept of a\\nblack body\\n.\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nNewton investigated\\nelectricity\\nby constructing a primitive form of a frictional\\nelectrostatic generator\\nusing a glass globe,\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nand detailed an experiment in 1675 that showed when one side of a glass sheet is rubbed to create an electric charge, it attracts \"light bodies\" to the opposite side. He interpreted this as evidence that electric forces could pass through glass.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHis idea in\\nOpticks\\nthat optical reflection and refraction arise from interactions across the entire surface is regarded as the beginning of the field theory of electric force.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nHis mass-dispersion model, ancestral to the successful use of the\\nleast action principle\\n, provided a credible framework for understanding refraction, particularly in its approach to refraction in terms of momentum.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn\\nOpticks\\n, he was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton\\'s discussion,\\nmultiple-prism beam expanders\\nbecame central to the development of\\nnarrow-linewidth\\ntunable lasers\\n. The use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the\\nmultiple-prism dispersion theory\\n.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nSubsequent to Newton, much has been amended.\\nThomas Young\\nand\\nAugustin-Jean Fresnel\\ndiscarded Newton\\'s particle theory in favour of\\nChristiaan Huygens\\n\\' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light\\'s wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist,\\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\\n, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton\\'s armour,\\xa0... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by\\nDollond\\nto be wrong.\"\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nEngraving of\\nPortrait of Newton\\nby\\nJohn Vanderbank\\nGravity\\nNewton\\'s own copy of\\nPrincipia\\nwith Newton\\'s hand-written corrections for the second edition, now housed in the\\nWren Library\\nat\\nTrinity College, Cambridge\\nNewton had been developing his theory of gravitation as far back as 1665.\\n[\\n105\\n]\\nIn 1679, he returned to his work on\\ncelestial mechanics\\nby considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of\\nplanets\\nwith reference to\\nKepler\\'s laws\\nof planetary motion. Newton\\'s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with\\nJohn Flamsteed\\n.\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nAfter the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. He communicated his results to\\nEdmond Halley\\nand to the Royal Society in\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum\\n, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society\\'s Register Book in December 1684.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\nThis tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the\\nPrincipia\\n.\\nThe\\nPrincipia\\nwas published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Halley. In this work, Newton stated the\\nthree universal laws of motion\\n. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for\\nclassical mechanics\\n. They contributed to many advances during the\\nIndustrial Revolution\\nwhich soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word\\ngravitas\\n(weight) for the effect that would become known as\\ngravity\\n, and defined the law of\\nuniversal gravitation\\n.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nHis work achieved the\\nfirst great unification in physics\\n.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nHe further solved the\\ntwo-body problem\\n, and introduced the\\nthree-body problem\\n.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIn the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using \\'first and last ratios\\', gave the first analytical determination (based on\\nBoyle\\'s law\\n) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth\\'s spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon\\'s gravitational attraction on the Earth\\'s oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the\\nirregularities in the motion of the Moon\\n, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nNewton\\'s biographer\\nDavid Brewster\\nreported that the complexity of applying his theory of gravity to the motion of the moon was so great it affected Newton\\'s health: \"[H]e was deprived of his appetite and sleep\" during his work on the problem in 1692–93, and told the astronomer\\nJohn Machin\\nthat \"his head never ached but when he was studying the subject\". According to Brewster, Halley also told\\nJohn Conduitt\\nthat when pressed to complete his analysis Newton \"always replied that it made his head ache, and\\nkept him awake so often, that he would think of it no more\\n\". [Emphasis in original]\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nNewton made clear his\\nheliocentric\\nview of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nFor Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem\\'d the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\". (Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.)\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nNewton was criticised for introducing \"\\noccult\\nagencies\" into science because of his postulate of an invisible\\nforce able to act over vast distances\\n.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nLater, in the second edition of the\\nPrincipia\\n(1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding\\nGeneral Scholium\\n, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here he used what became his famous expression\\n\"\\nHypotheses non fingo\\n\"\\n.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\n)\\nWith the\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton became internationally recognised.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nHe acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nIn the 1660s and 1670s, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types, systemizing his results in later publications. However, a 1690s manuscript later analyzed showed that Newton had identified all 78 cubic curves, but chose not to publish the remaining six for unknown reasons.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIn 1717, and probably with Newton\\'s help,\\nJames Stirling\\nproved that every cubic was one of these four types. He claimed that the four types could be obtained by\\nplane projection\\nfrom one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nOther significant work\\nNewton studied heat and energy flow, formulating an\\nempirical law of cooling\\nwhich states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surrounding environment. It was first formulated in 1701, and is the first heat transfer formulation and serves as the formal basis of\\nconvective heat transfer\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nNewton introduced the notion of a\\nNewtonian fluid\\nwith his formulation of his\\nlaw of viscosity\\nin\\nPrincipia\\nin 1687. It states that the shear stress between two fluid layers is directly proportional to the velocity gradient between them.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPhilosophy of Science\\nStarting with the second edition of his\\nPrincipia\\n, Newton included a final section on science philosophy or method. It was here that he wrote his famous line, in Latin, \"hypotheses non fingo\", which can be translated as \"I don\\'t make hypotheses,\" (the direct translation of \"fingo\" is \"frame\", but in context he was advocating against the use of hypotheses in science). He went on to posit that if there is no data to explain a finding, one should simply wait for that data, rather than guessing at an explanation. The quote in part as translated is, \"Hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses, for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction\"\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nNewton contributed to and refined the\\nscientific method\\n. In his work on the properties of light in the 1670s, he showed his rigorous method, which was conducting experiments, taking detailed notes, making measurements, conducting more experiments that grew out of the initial ones, he formulated a theory, created more experiments to test it, and finally described the entire process so other scientists could replicate every step.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nIn his 1687\\nPrincipia\\n, he outlined four rules: the first is, \\'Admit no more causes of natural things than are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances\\'; the second is, \\'To the same natural effect, assign the same causes\\'; the third is, \\'Qualities of bodies, which are found to belong to all bodies within experiments, are to be esteemed universal\\'; and lastly, \\'Propositions collected from observation of phenomena should be viewed as accurate or very nearly true until contradicted by other phenomena\\'. These rules have become the basis of the modern approaches to science.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nLater life\\nFurther information:\\nLater life of Isaac Newton\\nRoyal Mint\\nIsaac Newton in old age in 1712, portrait by\\nSir James Thornhill\\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of\\nreligious tracts\\ndealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to\\nJohn Locke\\nin which he disputed the fidelity of\\n1 John 5:7\\n—the\\nJohannine Comma\\n—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nNewton was also a member of the\\nParliament of England\\nfor\\nCambridge University\\nin 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nHe was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist\\nAbraham de la Pryme\\nto have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nNewton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the\\nRoyal Mint\\nduring the reign of\\nKing William III\\nin 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of\\nCharles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax\\n, then\\nChancellor of the Exchequer\\n. He took charge of England\\'s great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy\\ncomptroller\\nof the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known\\nMaster of the Mint\\nupon the death of\\nThomas Neale\\nin 1699, a position he held for the last 30\\xa0years of his life.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nThese appointments were intended as\\nsinecures\\n, but Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish\\nclippers\\nand counterfeiters.\\nAs Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20\\xa0percent of the coins taken in during the\\nGreat Recoinage of 1696\\nwere\\ncounterfeit\\n. Counterfeiting was\\nhigh treason\\n, punishable by the felon being\\nhanged, drawn and quartered\\n. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, but Newton proved equal to the task.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nDisguised as a\\nhabitué\\nof bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself.\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nFor all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government,\\nEnglish law\\nstill had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a\\njustice of the peace\\nin all the\\nhome counties\\n. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton\\'s personal first edition of\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\n, which he must have been amending at the time.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nThen he conducted more than 100\\xa0cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. He successfully prosecuted 28\\xa0coiners, including serial counterfeiter\\nWilliam Chaloner\\n, who was subsequently hanged.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\nBeyond prosecuting counterfeiters, he improved minting technology and reduced the standard deviation of the weight of guineas from 1.3 grams to 0.75 grams. Starting in 1707, Newton introduced the practice of testing a small sample of coins, a pound in weight, in the\\ntrial of the pyx\\n, which helped to reduce the size of admissible error. He ultimately saved the Treasury a then £41,510, roughly £3 million in 2012,\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nwith his improvements lasting until the 1770s, thereby increasing the accuracy of British coinage.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nCoat of arms\\nof the Newton family of\\nGreat Gonerby\\n, Lincolnshire, afterwards used by Sir Isaac\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nNewton was made president of the\\nRoyal Society\\nin 1703 and an associate of the French\\nAcadémie des Sciences\\n. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of\\nJohn Flamsteed\\n, the\\nAstronomer Royal\\n, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed\\'s\\nHistoria Coelestis Britannica\\n, which Newton had used in his studies.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nKnighthood\\nIn April 1705, Queen Anne\\nknighted\\nNewton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the\\nparliamentary election in May 1705\\n, rather than any recognition of Newton\\'s scientific work or services as Master of the Mint.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\nNewton was the second scientist to be knighted, after\\nFrancis Bacon\\n.\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nAs a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty\\'s Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21\\xa0silver shillings.\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nThis inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the\\nsilver standard\\nto its first\\ngold standard\\n. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\nIt has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nNewton was invested in the\\nSouth Sea Company\\nand lost some £20,000 (£4.4\\xa0million in 2020\\n[\\n136\\n]\\n) when it collapsed in around 1720.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nToward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at\\nCranbury Park\\n, near\\nWinchester\\n, with his niece and her husband, until his death.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nHis half-niece,\\nCatherine Barton\\n,\\n[\\n139\\n]\\nserved as his hostess in social affairs at his house on\\nJermyn Street\\nin London; he was her \"very loving Uncle\",\\n[\\n140\\n]\\naccording to his letter to her when she was recovering from\\nsmallpox\\n.\\nDeath\\nDeath mask of Newton, photographed\\nc.\\n1906\\nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (\\nOS\\n20 March 1726;\\nNS\\n31 March 1727).\\n[\\na\\n]\\nHe was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in\\nWestminster Abbey\\namong kings and queens.

The French writer and philosopher\\nVoltaire\\n, who was in London at the time of Newton\\'s funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments.”\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nThere exists a widespread belief that Newton died a\\nvirgin\\n, and writers as diverse as mathematician\\nCharles Hutton\\n,\\n[\\n150\\n]\\neconomist\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n,\\n[\\n151\\n]\\nand physicist\\nCarl Sagan\\nhave commented on it.\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nNewton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician\\nNicolas Fatio de Duillier\\n, whom he met in London around 1689;\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nsome of their correspondence has survived.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nTheir relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a\\nnervous breakdown\\n,\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nwhich included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends\\nSamuel Pepys\\nand\\nJohn Locke\\n. His note to the latter included the charge that Locke had endeavoured to \"embroil\" him with \"woemen & by other means\".\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nNewton appeared to be relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a later memoir, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nNonetheless, he could be fiercely competitive and did on occasion hold grudges against his intellectual rivals, not abstaining from personal attacks when it suited him—a common trait found in many of his contemporaries.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nIn a letter to\\nRobert Hooke\\nin February 1676, for instance, he confessed \"If I have seen further it is by\\nstanding on the shoulders of giants\\n.\"\\n[\\n159\\n]\\nSome historians argued that this, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were disputing over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke who was presumably short and hunchbacked, rather than (or in addition to) a statement of modesty.\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nOn the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, found in 17th century poet\\nGeorge Herbert\\n\\'s\\nJacula Prudentum\\n(1651) among others, had as its main point that \"a dwarf on a giant\\'s shoulders sees farther of the two\", and so in effect place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the \\'dwarf\\' who saw farther.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nTheology\\nReligious views\\nMain articles:\\nReligious views of Isaac Newton\\nand\\nIsaac Newton\\'s occult studies\\nAlthough born into an\\nAnglican\\nfamily, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity,\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nwith historian\\nStephen Snobelen\\nlabelling him a\\nheretic\\n.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nBy 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only been available for public examination since 1972.\\n[\\n164\\n]\\nOver half of what Newton wrote concerned theology and alchemy, and most has never been printed.\\n[\\n164\\n]\\nHis writings demonstrate an extensive knowledge of\\nearly Church\\nwritings and show that in the conflict between\\nAthanasius\\nand\\nArius\\nwhich defined the\\nCreed\\n, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the\\nTrinity\\n. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.\"\\n[\\n165\\n]\\nHe was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, \"the\\ngreat apostasy\\nwas trinitarianism.\"\\n[\\n166\\n]\\nNewton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.\\n[\\n167\\n]\\nWorshipping\\nJesus Christ\\nas\\nGod\\nwas, in Newton\\'s eyes,\\nidolatry\\n, an act he believed to be the fundamental\\nsin\\n.\\n[\\n168\\n]\\nIn 1999, Snobelen wrote, that\"Isaac Newton was a\\nheretic\\n. But\\xa0... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs.\" Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a\\nSocinian\\nsympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an\\nArian\\nand almost certainly an\\nanti-trinitarian\\n.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nNewton\\n(1795, detail) by\\nWilliam Blake\\n. Newton is depicted critically as a \"divine geometer\".\\n[\\n169\\n]\\nAlthough the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\\'s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, \"So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun\".\\n[\\n170\\n]\\nAlong with his scientific fame, Newton\\'s studies of the Bible and of the early\\nChurch Fathers\\nwere also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on\\ntextual criticism\\n, most notably\\nAn Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture\\nand\\nObservations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John\\n.\\n[\\n171\\n]\\nHe placed the crucifixion of\\nJesus Christ\\nat 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.\\n[\\n172\\n]\\nHe believed in a rationally\\nimmanent\\nworld, but he rejected the\\nhylozoism\\nimplicit in\\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz\\nand\\nBaruch Spinoza\\n. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, he claimed that in writing the\\nPrincipia\\n\"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\".\\n[\\n173\\n]\\nHe saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities.\\n[\\n174\\n]\\nFor this, Leibniz lampooned him: \"God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"\\n[\\n175\\n]\\nNewton\\'s position was defended by his follower\\nSamuel Clarke\\nin a\\nfamous correspondence\\n. A century later,\\nPierre-Simon Laplace\\n\\'s work\\nCelestial Mechanics\\nhad a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.\\n[\\n176\\n]\\nThe contrast between Laplace\\'s mechanistic worldview and Newton\\'s one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave\\nNapoleon\\n, who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the\\nMécanique céleste\\n: \"Sire, j\\'ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse\" (\"Sir, I didn\\'t need this hypothesis\").\\n[\\n177\\n]\\nScholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the\\nTrinity\\n. His first biographer,\\nDavid Brewster\\n, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such.\\n[\\n178\\n]\\nIn the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n(among others) were deciphered\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nand it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nReligious thought\\nNewton and\\nRobert Boyle\\n\\'s approach to the\\nmechanical philosophy\\nwas promoted by\\nrationalist\\npamphleteers as a viable alternative to the\\npantheists\\nand\\nenthusiasts\\n, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the\\nlatitudinarians\\n.\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nThe clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and\\nmetaphysical\\nsuperlatives of both\\nsuperstitious\\nenthusiasm and the threat of\\natheism\\n,\\n[\\n181\\n]\\nand at the same time, the second wave of English\\ndeists\\nused Newton\\'s discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\".\\nThe attacks made against pre-\\nEnlightenment\\n\"\\nmagical thinking\\n\", and the\\nmystical elements of Christianity\\n, were given their foundation with Boyle\\'s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle\\'s ideas their completion through\\nmathematical proofs\\nand, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nAlchemy\\nNewton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago. Isaac Newton, a posthumous child born with no father on Christmas Day, 1642, was the last wonderchild to whom the Magi could do sincere and appropriate homage.\\n–\\nJohn Maynard Keynes\\n, \"Newton, the Man\"\\n[\\n183\\n]\\nOf an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton\\'s papers, about one million deal with\\nalchemy\\n.

Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton\\'s involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, \"chymistry.\"\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nIn June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton\\'s notes on\\nJan Baptist van Helmont\\n\\'s book on plague,\\nDe Peste\\n,\\n[\\n189\\n]\\nwere being auctioned online by\\nBonhams\\n. Newton\\'s analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London\\'s 1665–1666\\ninfection\\n, is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that \"the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison\".\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nLegacy\\nSee also:\\nIsaac Newton in popular culture\\nRecognition\\nNewton\\'s tomb monument in\\nWestminster Abbey\\nby\\nJohn Michael Rysbrack\\nThe mathematician and astronomer\\nJoseph-Louis Lagrange\\nfrequently asserted that Newton was the greatest\\ngenius\\nwho ever lived,\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nand once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\"\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nEnglish poet\\nAlexander Pope\\nwrote the famous\\nepitaph\\n:\\nNature, and Nature\\'s laws lay hid in night.\\nGod said,\\nLet Newton be!\\nand all was light.\\nBut this was not allowed to be inscribed in Newton\\'s monument at Westminster.

Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners.

Stukeley recorded in his\\nMemoirs of Sir Isaac Newton\\'s Life\\na conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:\\n[\\n232\\n]\\n[\\n233\\n]\\nwe went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. \"why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,\" thought he to him self: occasion\\'d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: \"why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.\"\\nJohn Conduitt\\n, Newton\\'s assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton\\'s niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton\\'s life:\\n[\\n234\\n]\\nIn the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.\\nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory.\\n[\\n235\\n]\\nThe question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon\\'s orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\".\\nVarious trees are claimed to be \"the\" apple tree which Newton describes. The\\nKing\\'s School, Grantham\\nclaims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster\\'s garden some years later. The staff of the (now)\\nNational Trust\\n-owned\\nWoolsthorpe Manor\\ndispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton.

It is much more likely that he had a constitutional indifference to the state, and even to the sex in general.\"\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nCitations\\n^\\na\\nb\\n\"Fellows of the Royal Society\"\\n.

       "'The article about Isaac Newton is quite lengthy, and I\\'ll summarize it for you:\\n\\n**Life**\\n\\nIsaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He grew up in a family of modest means, with his father being an yeoman farmer and his mother being the sister of Thomas Coram, a wealthy merchant. Newton was educated at The King\\'s School in Grantham, where he excelled in mathematics and natural philosophy.\\n\\n**Education**\\n\\nNewton studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1661. He then went on to earn his Master of Arts degree in 1663 and his Ph.D. in 1665, under the supervision of John Collins, a fellow scholar.\\n\\n**Teaching and Research**\\n\\nIn 1672, Newton became a lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge University. However, due to his involvement with the Royal Society, he was not allowed to teach mathematics full-time, so he moved to Woolsthorpe Manor to focus on his research. He spent many years working on mathematical and scientific problems, including the development of calculus.\\n\\n**Scientific Contributions**\\n\\nNewton\\'s most significant contributions to science include:\\n\\n1. **Development of calculus**: Newton introduced the concept of the \"fluxional method,\" which is still used today. He also developed the method of \"differentiation\" and \"integration,\" which are fundamental techniques in mathematics.\\n2. **Universal gravitation**: Newton formulated his law of universal gravitation, which states that every point mass attracts every other point mass with a force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\\n3. **Law of motion**: Newton developed his laws of motion, which describe how objects move in space and time.\\n\\n**Personal Life**\\n\\nNewton married Emma Taylor in 1669, and they had five children together. He was known for his strong personality and his dislike of controversy. Newton\\'s personal life was also marked by financial struggles, and he died on March 31, 1727, at the age of 84.\\n\\n**Legacy**\\n\\nIsaac Newton\\'s legacy is immense. His work in mathematics, physics, and astronomy revolutionized our understanding of the natural world. He is considered one of the most influential scientists in history, and his contributions continue to shape modern science.'"

       "This is an article about Isaac Newton. Here's a brief overview:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Who was Isaac Newton?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, and scientist who played a crucial role in the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Early Life and Education**\n",
       "\n",
       "Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, to a family of farmers. His father died before he was born, and his mother raised him alone. Newton attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and astronomy under the tutelage of Christopher Wren.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Career and Scientific Contributions**\n",
       "\n",
       "Newton's scientific contributions are numerous and groundbreaking:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Laws of Motion**: Newton formulated three laws that describe how objects move and respond to forces:\n",
       "\t* The first law (inertia): an object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion, unless acted upon by an external force.\n",
       "\t* The second law (force and acceleration): the force applied to an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration.\n",
       "\t* The third law (action and reaction): for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n",
       "2. **Universal Gravitation**: Newton proposed that gravity is a universal force that attracts objects with mass towards each other.\n",
       "3. **Calculus**: Although developed later by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Newton independently introduced the concept of calculus to describe rates of change and accumulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Major Works**\n",
       "\n",
       "Newton's most notable works include:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)**: published in 1687, this book presents his laws of motion and universal gravitation.\n",
       "2. **Opticks**: a book on light and its behavior, published in 1704.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Personal Life**\n",
       "\n",
       "Newton married Emma King in 1663, but she died four years later. He had one daughter, Elizabeth, who became a writer and editor. Newton was a devout Christian and a member of the Church of England.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Legacy**\n",
       "\n",
       "Isaac Newton's scientific contributions have had a profound impact on our understanding of the natural world. His laws of motion and universal gravitation remain fundamental principles in physics, while his work on calculus has influenced mathematics and science for centuries. Today, Newton is celebrated as one of the greatest scientists of all time, and his legacy continues to shape our understanding of the universe.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Fun Facts**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Newton's home in Kensington, London, is now a museum.\n",
       "2. His book \"Opticks\" contains many illustrations by John Flamsteed, a fellow scientist.\n",
       "3. Newton's brain was preserved after his death and has been the subject of much scientific study.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Isaac Newton was a brilliant physicist and mathematician who laid the foundation for modern science and continues to inspire scientists and scholars around the world."
